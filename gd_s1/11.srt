1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,171
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:03,960
Dr. Coyle... He's a little too friendly.

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:05,437
I'm sure he's just trying
to establish a rapport.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,933
I give great massages.

5
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:08,164
And I'll make a killer omelet
in the morning.

6
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,953
That's really inappropriate. I said no.

7
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,021
You're approaching insubordination.

8
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,823
You have to file a complaint with HR.

9
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:16,225
They will shift the blame
onto me. Like you did.

10
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:20,162
I've just been fired for physically
assaulting an employee.

11
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:21,831
So, why do I need to quit my job
to have a family?

12
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,066
Agreed. She can be
a great lawyer and a great mom.

13
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,301
I don't want to have kids.

14
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:27,236
I don't need a therapist.

15
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,039
- I want to make my own decisions.
- I am done talking.

16
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:31,273
- Now let's go.
- No. N-No.

17
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,342
- I don't want help!
- Where would he go?

18
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,643
Is there a place he likes to hang out?

19
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,845
I mean, he's not at the hospital.

20
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:37,179
And there used to be a picture here.

21
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:38,848
It means he's not coming back.

22
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,819
Hi. Good morning.

23
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:45,387
I'm Aaron Glassman. Dr. Glassman.

24
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:46,822
I work with Shaun.

25
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,591
Hi. Nice to meet you.

26
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,759
It's nice to meet you, too.
May I speak with him, please?

27
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:53,462
Uh, Shaun isn't here.

28
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:58,634
I know you've been helping
Shaun, and I appreciate that,

29
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:00,736
but I really need
to speak with him immediately.

30
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:04,238
I'll definitely let him know
when I see him next.

31
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:05,975
I'm... I'm sorry.

32
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:08,377
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shaun, I know you're in here.

33
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:10,846
I just... I just want to talk, please.

34
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:12,147
You are way out of line.

35
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,516
Shaun, you have responsibilities.

36
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,985
We've got to sort this out.

37
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,686
You have five seconds
to get the hell out of here...

38
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:19,081
- Shaun.
- ...or I'm calling the police.

39
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:20,389
- Shaun, I just...
- What are...

40
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,424
I just want to...

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,447
- Five...
- Shaun.

42
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,196
Shaun, she's calling the police.

43
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:28,664
- ...four...
- Is that what you want?

44
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,220
...three...

45
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:31,600
- ...two...
- Okay, okay.

46
00:01:31,669 --> 00:01:33,235
- ...one.
- Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

47
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,338
It's just that Shaun has a-a tendency

48
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,604
to run away from conflict.

49
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,775
And in Casper and medical school,

50
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,144
people will give you
a little bit of slack, but it...

51
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,846
now he's in a very hard-to-get job

52
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,648
in a very competitive environment

53
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,917
where people do not give you
a second chance.

54
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,520
Still, not cool.

55
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,239
If you speak with him

56
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,207
will you call me, please?

57
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,630
Out.

58
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,570
Yeah.

59
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,547
So, what's your plan now?

60
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:24,101
I don't know.

61
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,112
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

62
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:37,047
I gotta say, he seems like
a nebby, old jerk.

63
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,616
- And a bully.
- What's "nebby"?

64
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:42,052
Nosey. It's a Pittsburgh thing.

65
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:43,687
I mean, you're a grown man.

66
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,956
If you don't want to talk to
him, it's none of his business.

67
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:50,060
San Jose is too big.

68
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:52,596
I get not liking San Jose.

69
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,231
I'm not the biggest fan myself, but...

70
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,666
I don't want to see a therapist.

71
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:58,135
So don't.

72
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,373
I should go back to Casper.

73
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,808
I have a rule.

74
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,186
<i>Never</i> make an important
decision while you are angry,

75
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:12,082
upset, high, or right before
or after having sex.

76
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,818
Okay, you are overworked, stressed out,

77
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:15,986
and pissed off at your boss.

78
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,989
Now is not the time
to be making a big decision.

79
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,392
You need to take a break,
clear your head.

80
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,749
You need a vacation.

81
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:27,697
I have to work five more months
before I earn a vacation.

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,833
So call in sick.

83
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,635
I'm not sick.

84
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:33,737
You're so adorable.

85
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,573
You don't have to<i> be</i> sick
to call in sick.

86
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,142
Ah, I have so much
to teach you, Grasshopper.

87
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:42,312
And I'm gonna start with
a good, old-fashioned road trip.

88
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:44,081
It's the perfect way
to get your mojo back.

89
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,416
And when we return, you're
gonna know exactly what to do

90
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,220
about San Jose, therapy,
and Glassy the Grouch.

91
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,354
And all you have to do

92
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,857
to attain this superior wisdom
and knowledge

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,450
is to call... in... sick.

94
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,504
Okay. Okay. I will.

95
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,210
Dr. Melendez. Got a case for you.

96
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:14,544
My schedule's pretty packed today.

97
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,481
It's a patient of mine.
She needs a kidney transplant.

98
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,416
You have a donor?

99
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,852
Her identical twin...
a perfect DNA match.

100
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:23,086
Why is she a patient of yours?

101
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:25,755
I put balloon tissue expanders
under both girls' scalps

102
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,958
to prepare them
for the separation surgery.

103
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,326
Separation surgery?

104
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,734
It's in six months, after they
recover from the transplant.

105
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:39,169
Of course, if you're too busy...

106
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,138
No. I'm in.

107
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,627
- Where's Murphy?
- He's not here yet.

108
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,879
Wrong day to be late.
We're already shorthanded.

109
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,816
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that. I did not fire Kalu.

110
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,318
And if you have a problem
with it, talk to Andrews.

111
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,188
Although, if you want my advice,
don't have a problem with it.

112
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,992
Andrews is waiting
to brief us on a new case.

113
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,195
It's a kidney transplant
on craniopagus twins.

114
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:06,963
Conjoined?

115
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:08,198
They're connected at the skull.

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,834
Their entire renal-vascular
systems are interdependent.

117
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,969
Cool.

118
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,372
Hey. Have either of you talked to Shaun?

119
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,487
- No.
- No, which isn't unusual.

120
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:19,676
Is anything wrong?

121
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,979
No, no, not with Shaun.
It's a family emergency.

122
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,799
- He's gonna be out for a few days.
- He's supposed to get approval

123
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,500
for any personal days
from his attending.

124
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,919
Right, which is why I'm checking in.

125
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,688
I think he thought it was enough
just to notify me.

126
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:45,463
You call in sick?

127
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:49,573
I'm ready to go.

128
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,628
No, you're not.

129
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,912
You're gonna need more than
a family photo and a toothbrush.

130
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,819
- Go pack.
- Uh, where are we going?

131
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,254
Wherever the car takes us.

132
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,324
- I don't like the beach.
- Okay, I will let the car know.

133
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,771
Even with your cardiovascular issues,

134
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:13,430
a kidney transplant
is a relatively safe procedure,

135
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,298
especially since, with identical twins,

136
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,267
there's no chance for organ rejection.

137
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:19,236
Just make sure you keep straight
which one's which.

138
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,739
The charming, pretty one
has the good kidneys.

139
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:25,475
Don't worry. We always triple confirm.

140
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,777
And we put everything in writing.

141
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,512
And you're both charming and pretty.

142
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,528
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a joke, Mom.

143
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:32,896
And smart.

144
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,484
They're gonna be Ivy Leaguers
in the fall.

145
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:36,753
- Yale and Harvard.
- Wow.

146
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:38,588
Mom, you don't have to tell
everyone you meet

147
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,913
- where we're going to college.
- Yes, I do.

148
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,226
That's awesome. Congratulations.

149
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:46,129
So, who's going where?

150
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,131
What do you think?
She's totally obnoxious

151
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,666
and thinks she's way funnier
than she is.

152
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:52,184
- Definitely Harvard.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:55,309
Hey, don't make me start
mocking your tattoo.

154
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,711
I thought you would have
your entire apartment

155
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:02,979
strapped to your back.

156
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,815
- It takes me a long time to pack.
- That's good.

157
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,318
An anal-retentive packer
is the exact type of person

158
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,719
I'd want operating on me.

159
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:12,055
Lea, this... this is your car.

160
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're gonna take my other one.

161
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:17,619
Okay. What do you do at work?

162
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,563
Do you really care what I do,
or do you just want to know

163
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:23,366
how someone with such a crappy
apartment can afford two cars?

164
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:27,470
I just want to know
how you can afford two cars.

165
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,472
Hmm.

166
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,740
Yeah, I can't.

167
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:33,076
Uh, my Grandpa Rod died last year,

168
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:36,579
and he left me
his most prized possession.

169
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,697
It's the S-Striped Tomato.

170
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,820
Oh, my God. You like "Starsky & Hutch"?

171
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,369
It's okay.

172
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,658
A meticulous packer
<i>and</i> a "Starsky & Hutch" fan.

173
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,026
Grandpa Rod would have loved you.

174
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,204
Okay. This is it. The road.

175
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,872
You sure you want to do this?

176
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:05,875
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

177
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,645
I'm sure.

178
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,881
Let's go, Lea.

179
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,707
Here we go!

180
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:27,642
I hear Murphy's AWOL.

181
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,970
He's taking a few personal days.

182
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:32,439
<i>- Unapproved</i> personal days.
- I approved them.

183
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,786
It's not your job to approve them.

184
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:37,175
Or to<i> say</i> you approved them
to cover up the fact

185
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,955
that Murphy's frequent tardiness
has escalated to absences.

186
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,334
What do you want me to do,
take a polygraph?

187
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,726
How about we jump into
enhanced interrogation?

188
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,167
Here, how about this?
Do you want me to turn this on?

189
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,730
When the board was reconsidering
your hiring of Murphy,

190
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:56,080
you assured us that if he was
anything less than excellent,

191
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,336
he'd be dismissed and you would resign.

192
00:08:58,361 --> 00:08:59,365
I trust you remember that.

193
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,810
I wouldn't have your movers
pack up your office just yet.

194
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,873
You can't protect Murphy forever.

195
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:09,909
At some point, he needs
to succeed or fail on his own.

196
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:16,784
Okay, that's three hours
on the warm ischemia clock

197
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,887
of the transplanted kidney.

198
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,955
The ureter is attached to the bladder.

199
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,048
How's the kidney's placement
in the iliac fossa?

200
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:28,896
No kinking or twisting
of the renal vessel.

201
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,685
Good.

202
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,578
You ready to close?

203
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:36,704
Yes.

204
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:41,775
Your best bet is a continuous
suture along the fascial layer.

205
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,743
Suture.

206
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:49,049
Donor's pressure's dropping.

207
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,307
Okay, up the oxygen.

208
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:51,795
Jenny must be bleeding internally.

209
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,986
We're gonna have to open her back up.

210
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,654
Staple remover.

211
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:04,220
I like trees.

212
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:06,309
Yeah? What else do you like?

213
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:08,100
Besides reading medical journals

214
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,037
and watching reruns of old cop shows?

215
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,239
I like you.

216
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:15,607
Well, who wouldn't? I'm very likeable.

217
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,344
Why don't you like San Jose?

218
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,779
Everyone's so competitive here.

219
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,682
You know, if you didn't make
a million by 30,

220
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:24,716
you're a total loser.

221
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,053
I don't need $1 million.

222
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:30,121
I don't even think
I need $90,000, but...

223
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,424
You know what we both need
are some tunes.

224
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,926
What's your preferred driving music?

225
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:37,028
M-Music... No. N...
I don't like music. No. No.

226
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,398
What? No, no. Not okay.

227
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,734
Okay, I will give you a pass
on not liking the beach

228
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:44,035
because you're cute

229
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,271
and I might need you to do
brain surgery on me someday,

230
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:49,240
but not liking music... unacceptable.

231
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:52,110
- I won't have it.
- Are you being sarcastic?

232
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,631
No. I'm being...

233
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,582
I actually don't know the word
for it, but my point stands.

234
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,571
Music is amazing.

235
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,830
You know, I remember
every important thing

236
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,220
that has ever happened to me

237
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:06,894
based on what song
I was listening to at the time.

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,277
I remember smells.

239
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:13,163
Like our parking garage
smells like fabric softener,

240
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,867
and when my brother died,
it smelled like burnt food.

241
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,769
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

242
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,309
How did he, um...
if you don't mind me asking?

243
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,275
My father was mean.

244
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:34,317
He killed my pet, so my brother
and I, we ran away.

245
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,352
Then he fell off a train
we were playing on,

246
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:37,954
hit his head, and died.

247
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:43,595
I never went back home.

248
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:47,556
Dr. Glassman has watched out
for me ever since.

249
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:54,268
Okay, so, maybe he's not
that much of a nebby jerk.

250
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,243
What are you smelling right now?

251
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:03,979
Pine trees.

252
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,283
Mm. I'm never gonna forget

253
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:10,285
that when you told me
about your brother and your dad,

254
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:12,521
it smelled like pine trees.

255
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,690
But I don't want you to ever forget

256
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,492
that right after you told me,
we were listening to...

257
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,229
Ouch. No. Do not remember that.

258
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:22,831
Or that.

259
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,376

Jenny had a post-op renal-vein rupture.

271
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,941
We were able to repair it
before she lost too much blood.

272
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,570
Both your vitals are stable now,

273
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,505
and Katie's new kidney
is functioning well.

274
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:05,657
Thank God.

275
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,063
Will her ruptured vein have any
effect on our separation surgery?

276
00:13:09,212 --> 00:13:10,344
It better not.

277
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:12,045
Katie, I love you,
but if I have to spend

278
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,413
one minute more than I have to

279
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:15,916
watching you practicing
some Mozart song...

280
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,619
- They're not songs. They're concertos.
- Pbht!

281
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:21,788
Don't worry.
Six months is still the plan.

282
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,959
Look, what I did
was incredibly unprofessional

283
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,718
and just... inexcusable.

284
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,638
But I'm guessing
you're gonna give one anyway.

285
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,335
No.

286
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:49,949
No, just an explanation
and a, uh... request.

287
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,686
It could help me to convince Andrews

288
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:54,954
I deserve a second chance.

289
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:58,323
Okay. Let's hear the explanation.

290
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:02,794
Dr. Browne and I are...
seeing each other.

291
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,564
Look, if you could just
put yourself in my shoes.

292
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:08,485
A woman I care about tells me
a guy harassed her,

293
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,302
and, even worse,
she tells me it's my fault

294
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,438
because I was too...
too stupidly insensitive

295
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,773
to understand
what she was going through.

296
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:18,277
I felt like crap.

297
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,480
And like an idiot,
I... tried to make it up to her.

298
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,220
All I'm asking for
is just a little understanding.

299
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,956
Wouldn't you have done the same thing?

300
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,197
Not my problem.

301
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,134
Yeah?

302
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,070
Jenny's bradycardic and hypotensive.

303
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,905
- What's happening?
- She was fine a minute ago.

304
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:50,107
We were talking, then she started
to have trouble breathing.

305
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,645
Jenny's heart is failing.

306
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,503
No pulse.

307
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,283
She's in V-tach.
Grab the cart, page Melendez.

308
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:10,630
Jenny's stable.

309
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,832
I have her on beta blockers
and vasodilators,

310
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,205
but it's not gonna be enough.

311
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,517
Renal-vein rupture must have caused

312
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,486
her already weak heart to deteriorate.

313
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:19,989
- She's in end-stage failure.
- I'll get her on the transplant registry.

314
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:21,674
What are we talking? Months? Weeks?

315
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,793
Days.

316
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,927
We're not gonna find
a donor heart in a few days.

317
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,700
We could disconnect her
from the other body

318
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:34,068
her heart is partially
oxygenating the blood for.

319
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,339
I was already pushing the envelope

320
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:38,596
to do the separation surgery

321
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,509
six months after a kidney transplant.

322
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,671
Do you really think they could
handle it one day after?

323
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,247
It may be our only choice.

324
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,318
Yeah.

325
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,624
His calls are an even bigger
buzzkill than this rain

326
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,927
and defeating the whole purpose
of this trip.

327
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,628
Okay.

328
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,228
Residents are not supposed to
turn off their phones.

329
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,201
How about we make a deal?

330
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:11,027
If you turn off your phone,
I'll let you drive.

331
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,395
- I don't have a driver's license.
- I know.

332
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,645
- I've always wanted to learn to drive.
- I know.

333
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:20,914
- Dr. Glassman... he never wanted me to.
- I know.

334
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,015
Actually, I didn't know that,

335
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,351
but that definitely sounds like Glassy.

336
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:27,955
Okay.

337
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,890
Yeah?

338
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,297
You're doing awesome.

339
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,903
You're a natural.

340
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,468
Thank you.

341
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,436
I think so, too.

342
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,660
Blinker.

343
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,772
All right, now make this left turn.

344
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,588
Okay, don't circle this time.

345
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,254
Just keep going straight.

346
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,519
What are you stopping for?

347
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,688
You want me to go out on the street?

348
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,919
It's where the car wants to go.

349
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:08,961
Come on.

350
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:11,797
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

351
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,501
I could run over someone and kill them.

352
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:18,789
You have autism. You're not blind.

353
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,338
And I'll be right here with you.

354
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,419
Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,638
Half Dome, here we come.

356
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,816
Can I turn on the radio?

357
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,319
- No! No, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

358
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,064
Nice.

359
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,472
We believe moving up
the separation surgery

360
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,507
will lighten the load on Jenny's heart,

361
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,975
maybe allow it to recover a bit

362
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,254
so a transplant won't even
be necessary in the future.

363
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,379
It is higher risk for Katie now,

364
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,714
given that her new kidney
is still not fully functional.

365
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,351
What do you think we should do?

366
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,719
It's your bodies. Your decision.

367
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,855
- Mom, stop it.
- No, I'm serious.

368
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,926
I raised you both to be strong
and independent, and you are.

369
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:19,542
So whatever you decide, I'll support.

370
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,823
Let's do it.

371
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,321
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

372
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,573
Katie?

373
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,174
We obviously need both your consent.

374
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,542
- Okay.
- You sure?

375
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,578
You want to talk more?
Have any questions?

376
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,348
No. I'm good. Let's do it.

377
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,420
I want a car.

378
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,688
So get one.

379
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,090
You've been driving a half-hour,

380
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,359
and you're already better than
half the people in San Jose.

381
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,327
I get distracted when I'm alone.

382
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,429
That's why I miss my bus sometimes.

383
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:57,967
Dr. Glassman thinks
I'd do the same thing driving.

384
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,735
He's probably right.

385
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,672
Want to have some fun?

386
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,408
- I'm already having fun.
- Stop the car.

387
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,942
- Why?
- Just do it.

388
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,080
Thank you.

389
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:15,583
Don't worry. We're the only car
on the road right now.

390
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:17,752
Put your left foot on the brake.

391
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,554
Mm, okay.

392
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,989
There we go.

393
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,892
Now hold it all the way down.
There you go.

394
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:26,895
Okay, now floor the gas
with your right foot.

395
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,034
- I-I don't know about this.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

396
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:36,738
Now slowly ease your left foot
off the brake...

397
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,474
...until you hear...

398
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,276
...this.

399
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,245
I smell smoke.

400
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,409
Yeah, that's the point, Shaun.

401
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,742
It's burning rubber. Do it again.

402
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,034
Okay.

403
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,563
Now, this is fun.

404
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,963
Okay, that's enough.

405
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:05,065
We need some rubber left to get us home.

406
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,233
I am burning rubber.

407
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:09,050
- Okay, Shaun, it's time to stop.
- Okay.

408
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,306
Shaun, take your other foot off the gas!

409
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:14,707
Shaun, look out!

410
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,340
It's the other foot! Other foot!

411
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,598
It's the other foot!
It's the other foot!

412
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:20,822
It's the other foot!

413
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,618
Dr. Ko and I
have been working for months

414
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,397
to map the structure of Jenny
and Katie's brain.

415
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:29,121
- Don't you mean "brains"?
- Actually,

416
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,457
while different regions operate
independently for each sister,

417
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,025
there is a single brain mass.

418
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,927
That's why all their
previous neurosurgeons

419
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,696
insisted separation was impossible.

420
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:39,164
The real problem won't be
dividing their<i> brains</i>

421
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,300
but dividing their<i> veins.</i>

422
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:44,336
They share a single sagittal sinus vein.

423
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,540
Which we'll give to Jenny.

424
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:48,173
Then we'll create a new one for Katie

425
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,741
using a grafted vein from her leg.

426
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,244
Nice. You've gotten them
up to speed fast.

427
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,646
Well, with 6 months of prep
to do in 12 hours,

428
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:55,914
it was their only choice.

429
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,678
So, let's get started.

430
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:58,850
- I crashed.
- We didn't.

431
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:00,119
- We just...
- Yes, I-I crashed.

432
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:01,720
- I hit something.
- Shaun. Shaun.

433
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,655
I hit something. I did. I hit something.

434
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:04,856
- Shaun, you...
- I know I did.

435
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,390
- I felt it. I crashed.
- Shaun, you didn't crash.

436
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,558
- Yes.
- You just drove off the road...

437
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,727
- No.
- ...and it was totally my fault.

438
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,061
No, you're wrong.
Nuh-unh. I hit something.

439
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:11,096
- No, you didn't.
- I felt it.

440
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:13,529
- I crashed. I crashed.
- No, Shaun, look at me. Calm down

441
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:15,310
- Okay. Okay.
- Look at me. Look at me.

442
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,735
Breathe.

443
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:19,803
Whatever happened, whatever
you felt, you did nothing wrong.

444
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:22,573
It was all my fault, okay?

445
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:29,047
Okay. Dr. Glassman... He was right.

446
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:32,316
I-I should not be allowed to drive.

447
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:34,352
No, no.

448
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:39,722
Shaun.

449
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,659
No, I'm not going to drive, thank you.

450
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:44,957
Yeah, I... I know. No one is.

451
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:48,031
'Cause you were right.
We did hit something.

452
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:05,014
Everything is still looking good.

453
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:07,516
If you need anything during the night,

454
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,299
just press your call button.

455
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:12,322
- Is Jenny asleep?
- Yeah.

456
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:13,822
Where's Dr. Andrews?

457
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:17,459
He is with Dr. Ko and Dr. Melendez.

458
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,329
They're working to finalize the
surgical protocol for tomorrow.

459
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,731
I need to talk to him.

460
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,298
Is there anything I can do?

461
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:29,004
I changed my mind.

462
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,940
I don't want to do
the separation surgery.

463
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:36,078
I'll go find him right away.

464
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:46,399
I understand she's scared,
but without this surgery,

465
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:47,991
there is a good chance both of them die.

466
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,275
Have you talked to the mother?

467
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,862
She refuses to weigh in,
insists it's their decision.

468
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:53,339
Let me try and talk to her.

469
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:54,614
I don't think that's a good idea.

470
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:55,979
You invented the technique

471
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:57,681
you're gonna use to separate them.

472
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:59,182
So?

473
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:01,417
So she's not even close to objective.

474
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,952
Okay, now is not the time
to be worrying about lawsuits.

475
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,054
That's my job.

476
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,725
And our job is saving
these girls' lives.

477
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,957
Okay, take it easy.
We're all on the same team here.

478
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,700
- I'll talk to her.
- You've already talked to her.

479
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:14,734
I will try again.

480
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,904
Browne should do it.

481
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:21,340
Me?

482
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,854
We need someone
that an 18year-old girl trusts.

483
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,479
She's also the best communicator
out of all of us.

484
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:34,994
Okay.

485
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,088
We'll give Katie the night
to think it over.

486
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,390
Browne, you'll talk to her
in the morning.

487
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:39,775
Get her to consent to this surgery.

488
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:42,561
And if I'm not able to do that?

489
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:49,234
It's not a big deal. Cars break.

490
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:52,137
That's why God
makes mechanics... and booze.

491
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,938
Two shots of tequila, please.

492
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I'm not thirsty.

493
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:58,643
You don't drink tequila
because you're thirsty.

494
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,013
Have you ever been drunk?

495
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:04,852
Never?

496
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:09,196
Eight years of college
a-and not one frat party?

497
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,055
Tailgating?
Your roommate's 21st birthday?

498
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,324
What<i> is</i> your job?

499
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,542
Now you're interested in my job?

500
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:16,994
Yes.

501
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,229
I'm an automotive engineer.

502
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:22,065
I work for a start-up
that's developing new designs

503
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,668
for self-driving cars.

504
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,335
Do you like it?

505
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,337
No.

506
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,738
Oh.

507
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,584
I like to build things,

508
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,544
not to sit in endless meetings
<i>talking</i> about building things.

509
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,880
Thank you.

510
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:38,415
Perfect timing.

511
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:41,718
We are supposed to be
forgetting about work.

512
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:49,392
For living happy
because you're a long time dead.

513
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,084
It's... good.

514
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:07,612
Oh, my God. You have to be
the first person in history

515
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:09,943
to actually like
their first tequila shot.

516
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:10,902
It's good.

517
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,148
- Do you want another?
- Okay.

518
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,228
- Yes.
- Tequila. Stat.

519
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:16,285
Yes!

520
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,146
What?

521
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:32,809
Sorry. I'm just zoned out.

522
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,260
We should break this off.

523
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:36,195
There's only so much studying
you can do.

524
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:45,875
Do you want kids?

525
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:49,195
Sorry. That's none of my business.

526
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,086
No, it's...

527
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,678
it's just not a question
I was expecting.

528
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,815
Jessica just told me she doesn't. Ever.

529
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,418
- Wow.
- It doesn't make any sense.

530
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,119
She would be such an amazing mother.

531
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,919
I guess she's lucky she realized
before it's too late.

532
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,716
Some women don't.

533
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,552
My mom was definitely one of those.

534
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,565
- Sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, it's okay.

535
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:18,403
Water under the bridge...
that nearly drowned me.

536
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,038
It was a long time ago.

537
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:23,549
I don't know what to do.

538
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:28,237
I can't imagine my life without her,

539
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:32,115
but I also can't imagine
a life without...

540
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:37,054
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,156
Again, this is not your problem.

542
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,858
- It's okay.
- Go. Goodbye.

543
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:51,832
Finding someone you can't
imagine a life without,

544
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,403
it's hard.

545
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:58,040
I know it's a cliché, but it is true.

546
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,080
Good night.

547
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:09,682
Good night.

I love you, too.

559
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:59,100
So, I will volunteer with
foster kids, coach youth sports.

560
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:01,513
There are other ways
that I can be a father figure

561
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,563
without actually being a father.

562
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:12,090
In one day, I taught
you how to play hooky from work,

563
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,257
how to drive, how to drink,

564
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,849
and how to totally
rock the house in karaoke.

565
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:19,619
No, y-you did not teach me
to drive very well at all.

566
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:21,154
- Ohhh.
- At all.

567
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:23,856
- Oh, how dare you.
- I-I-I crashed.

568
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:25,158
No, you didn't crash.

569
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,760
You hit a rock
that should not have been there.

570
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,595
The whole point of a road shoulder

571
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:31,691
is to provide a buffer zone.

572
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,044
Who the hell Desi...
designs a buffer zone

573
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,001
with a huge rock in it, you know?

574
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:38,471
They should be fired.

575
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:43,075
O-Okay, hold it right there, partner.

576
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:46,078
I got one more thing to teach you.

577
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,312
What is it?

578
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:50,549
The proper way to end a date.

579
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:56,020
Tell me you hope I had
a good time tonight.

580
00:28:57,391 --> 00:28:59,124
Go ahead.

581
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:04,722
I hope you had a good time tonight.

582
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:07,765
I did. I had a very nice time tonight.

583
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,335
You're really fun to sing karaoke with.

584
00:29:12,171 --> 00:29:14,438
Now tell me I'm really fun, too,

585
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,474
and that you hope
we can do it again soon.

586
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:22,346
Y-Y-You're really fun, too.

587
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:25,525
- Thank you.
- I hope that we can do it again soon.

588
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,785
Now open the door for me.

589
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:35,636
Now, if I just walk in,

590
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,162
don't bother trying for a second date.

591
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:40,397
It's a swing and a miss, not a big deal.

592
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,734
It happens to everyone.
But if I don't walk in,

593
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:46,269
if I just stand there in front of you

594
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:49,016
like I don't really want to go inside,

595
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:53,476
like I'm doing right now,
then you have to kiss me.

596
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,450
Kiss me, Shaun.

597
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:20,502
Have you ever done that before?

598
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,340
Uh, no, no, no, no.

599
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,826
Well, you're pretty good at it.

600
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:31,108
- You want to do it again?
- Yes, but...

601
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:33,162
But what?

602
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,425
Oof.

603
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:46,899
I know it's frightening.

604
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,913
You've already been through so much.

605
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:51,708
I'm not scared.

606
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:56,279
I just think, "What if this is
how we're meant to be?"

607
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:58,694
Maybe we're better as one.

608
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:07,603
I grew up in a trailer, um,

609
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:11,404
with, uh, my mom telling me every day

610
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,676
that I was no better than her

611
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,112
and that I would never do anything,

612
00:31:17,114 --> 00:31:18,779
I'd never be anyone,

613
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,896
and I...

614
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:23,484
I hated being there.

615
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,424
But when I finally left,

616
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:34,046
walking out of the dirty,
disgusting double-wide...

617
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:40,535
...was the hardest thing I've ever done.

618
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:44,339
Wait, so, am I the awful mom

619
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,407
or the disgusting trailer in this story?

620
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,343
Um...

621
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,090
It's amazing what you've
accomplished so far.

622
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:57,384
It really is.

623
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:02,923
But you can be so much more,

624
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:10,430
and with the freedom
to just finally be yourself.

625
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:14,894
Just yourself.

626
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:25,322
Katie's back on board.

627
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:26,906
Told you.

628
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,788
She's very persuasive.

629
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:40,092
Shaun?

630
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:53,319
I feel disgusting.

631
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,973
You're just hungover.

632
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:58,810
You are never gonna want me
to kiss you ever again.

633
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:02,714
If I had brushed my teeth
before I rushed out here,

634
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:05,483
I'd ask you to do it again right now.

635
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,087
Why are you so hard on yourself?

636
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:15,326
I'm sure you got made fun of
a lot when you were a kid,

637
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:17,695
and that leaves a mark.

638
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:18,963
I know.

639
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:22,400
But you gotta shake it off,
rub some dirt on it.

640
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,706
You're never gonna be happy
if you constantly live in fear.

641
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,217
- We need to talk.
- Look, I have nothing to say to you.

642
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,186
Well, then, you can just listen.

643
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,557
You are not a victim. Not even close.

644
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,757
But you will be
unless you convince Andrews

645
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,791
to reinstate Jared.

646
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,626
Are you threatening me?

647
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,329
No, I'm just informing you
that there is no way

648
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,397
that I'm the only resident
that you tried to intimidate

649
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,766
into having sex with you.

650
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:59,369
And I will make it my mission
in life to find every single one

651
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,037
and get them to file
a complaint against you

652
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,073
unless Jared gets his job back.

653
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,540
And what makes you so sure

654
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,876
- Andrews cares what I have to say?
- I'm not.

655
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,878
But either Jared's career gets saved,

656
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,732
or yours gets destroyed.

657
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,782
Either way is a win for me.

658
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,223
15 blade.

659
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:30,919
Removing the first balloon
tissue expander.

660
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,355
One down. Five to go.

661
00:34:56,923 --> 00:35:00,821
_

662
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:08,523
<i>Hi, Shaun. It's me again.</i>

663
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,446
<i>Um... you know,</i>

664
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:15,217
<i>Do... Dr. Andrews has never
really been in your corner,</i>

665
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:19,388
<i>and your absence is causing
a real problem.</i>

666
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,674
<i>Please call me before it's too late.</i>

667
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:26,439
<i>Or at least call me
and let me know where you are</i>

668
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:28,529
<i>'cause I'm worried.</i>

669
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,436
The cavitron allows us to use

670
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:39,741
a low-frequency sound wave
to separate them

671
00:35:39,743 --> 00:35:43,411
so that we don't damage the
healthy tissue in the process.

672
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,146
I still can't tell where
Katie starts and Jenny ends.

673
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:50,851
Mm-hmm. The imaging is a huge help.

674
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:54,589
But once the patient is opened,

675
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:58,426
it's kind of like backcountry skiing.

676
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:00,428
It's never the same on top.

677
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,225
What you want to focus on

678
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:05,132
is the terrain you know is underneath.

679
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:26,986

684
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:47,921

685

686
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:54,158
♪ Oooooh, ooh, ooh ♪

687
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,096

- Looks good. No leaks.

689
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:02,557

00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,276

701
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:44,125
Thanks for taking me on a road trip.

702
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:45,627
I feel a lot better.

703
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:49,521
I think I'm ready
to talk to Dr. Glassman.

704
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:54,484
Yeah, I feel much better, too,
and ready to talk to<i> my</i> boss.

705
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:56,953
What do you have to talk
to your boss about?

706
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,127
He offered me a promotion.

707
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:01,858
Will you be making $1 million?

708
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,793
Ha-ha. Very funny.

709
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:07,538
I make $70,000 now, and
the new position pays $90,000,

710
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:11,143
but I'm not gonna take it.

711
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:12,635
Why not?

712
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:15,237
It pays $20,000 more.

713
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:19,341
Yeah, I get the math, Shaun,
but just taking this trip and...

714
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:22,645
and you have inspired me to do something

715
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:24,146
that I've been thinking about
for a really long time,

716
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:26,534
but I've just been too scared to do it.

717
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,081
I'm gonna quit my job.

718
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,886
You're so silly.

719
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,554
What would you do during the day?

720
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,822
Rebuild old cars.

721
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:37,780
No more conference calls.
No more never-ending meetings.

722
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:43,865
The only thing I'm not looking
forward to is, uh... is moving.

723
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,500
Why would you move?

724
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:49,538
Because that's where the shop
that I'm gonna work at is.

725
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:51,439
I got the Striped Tomato.

726
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:53,875
My brother, Donny,
got Grandpa Rod's shop

727
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,444
in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

728
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,649
It's been over a year,
but every time I drive his car,

729
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:05,420
I...keep thinking,

730
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,789
"You know, I don't need
a more impressive title

731
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,251
or $1 million."

732
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,538
He would take me fishing
in Alaska every summer,

733
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:15,063
skiing every winter break.

734
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:18,142
I haven't taken more than
one day off in four years

735
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,433
because I always work.

736
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:20,953
It never stops.

737
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:26,156
And just taking this trip with
you made me realize I, uh...

738
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:30,911
I want to enjoy my life, you know?

739
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,950
Okay, what? Say something.

740
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:49,339
Oh.

741
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:51,120
You're...

742
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:09,315
Hello?

743
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:10,983
Jared, this is Dr. Andrews.
Do you have a moment?

744
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:12,518
Yeah, of course.

745
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,926
Dr. Coyle approached me today.

746
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:16,422
He told me that he feels awful

747
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,468
about the way he treated Dr. Browne

748
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:20,859
and how it came to affect you,

749
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,778
and he asked me to reconsider
your termination.

750
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:25,430
You should also know

751
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:27,365
that Dr. Melendez spoke
in support of you, as well.

752
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:29,841
Thank you for letting me know.

753
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:32,303
I was impressed by
the integrity you demonstrated

754
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,923
by taking full responsibility
for your actions.

755
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:37,943
And I'm certainly willing
to make that clear

756
00:40:37,945 --> 00:40:39,644
to any administrators
at another hospital

757
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:41,658
if you need me as a reference,

758
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,822
but I won't reinstate you.

759
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,651
Physical assault is a line

760
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,853
I'm just not willing
to let anyone cross.

761
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:51,156
I understand.

762
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,902
I'm sorry.

763
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,301
Take care.

764
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:03,934
When will they wake up?

765
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:11,709
They should've already.

766
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:16,361
Shaun?

767
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:21,212
