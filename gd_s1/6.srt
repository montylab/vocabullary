1
00:00:01,242 --> 00:00:02,945
<i>Previously on "The Good Doctor"...</i>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,367
Is there something
you're not telling me?

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,484
When we're in meetings together,
don't ever call my ideas "ridiculous."

4
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,171
Come on. I'm being serious.

5
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,262
So am I.

6
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:12,060
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

7
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:14,052
- And he picked you.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:17,189
A surgeon needs to communicate.
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

9
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,390
Can he do that under stress?

10
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,625
Can he do that knowing that a human life

11
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,309
literally hangs in the balance?

12
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,993
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,695
You're welcome. It's a special blend.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,997
I roast the beans myself.

15
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:34,731
Smells like leather.

16
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,700
Then none for you, Murphy.

17
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,703
I don't drink coffee.

18
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,138
It is dead in here.

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,074
That's why they call it
the graveyard shift.

20
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:47,310
Oh, well, I call it paradise.
You my trauma virgins?

21
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:50,213
Ah, Doctors Murphy, Kalu, Browne...

22
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:51,581
meet Dr. Audrey Lim,

23
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,983
your attending for the evening.

24
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,084
Hey. Coffee?

25
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,552
He roasts the beans himself.

26
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:58,054
Oh. Kiss ass.

27
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,324
E.R.

28
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:05,762
How long? Got it.

29
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:06,897
Listen up, everybody!

30
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,398
We got a mass cas coming in.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,300
It's a bus crash, two dozen passengers.

32
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,135
Transfer all patients waiting for beds

33
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:13,536
up to the nursing units.

34
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,138
Have maintenance bring down cots.

35
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,275
We're gonna convert
the waiting room into triage.

36
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,075
No one goes home till we're all clear!

37
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,854
Page everyone on call.
I don't care what department they are.

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,314
Tonight, everybody's trauma.
Glove up and line up.

39
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,157
EMTs will have triaged onsite,

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,926
so the patients
are gonna come in tagged.

41
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,563
I love these blank faces
right before Armageddon.

42
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:40,797
Trauma color coding... who knows it?

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,966
Green... walking wounded.
Yellow... observation.

44
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,401
Red needs immediate attention.

45
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,269
And black go straight to the morgue.

46
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:01,384
All right, red tags, front of the line!

47
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,853
Red tags, front of the line.

48
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:04,821
Wedding bus blew a tire and flipped!

49
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:06,156
26-year-old female.

50
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,591
Second-and third-degree burns

51
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:08,792
to her neck, chest, and left arm.

52
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,595
Kalu, you're up.

53
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,363
Trauma Six.

54
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,298
Guy was ejected
30 feet from the vehicle.

55
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,466
Multiple chest contusions,

56
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:18,168
acute respiratory distress on the scene,

57
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,469
sluggish pupillary response.

58
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,037
- How long have you been doing CPR?
- 12 minutes.

59
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,272
- Have you shocked him?
- Three times.

60
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,074
We got to crack him.
Dr. Browne, I got this.

61
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,742
You take the next one.
All right, Bay Five.

62
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:32,182
We secured the foreign object
and staunched the bleeding,

63
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:34,217
but didn't want to touch it otherwise.

64
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:40,056
- Good thing. It nicked her carotid.
- What is it?

65
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:41,391
Right now it's a little Dutch boy

66
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:42,592
keeping her from bleeding out.

67
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,462
Pulse ox is dropping. She's at 87.

68
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,230
O2 sats down to 83.

69
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,400
Forget about the neck, Claire.

70
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,534
Treat her like any other patient.

71
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,036
What are the first steps?

72
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:54,804
Airway, breathing, circulation.

73
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,007
Good. Grab a kit.

74
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:21,464
I need help here! Somebody, help!

75
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,999
Murphy, go!

76
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,871
Let's go.

77
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,139
Trauma Three.

78
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,288
I can't stop the bleeding.

79
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,594
- He's bleeding out.
- Do something.

80
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,938
I need a urinary catheter,
14-gauge needle,

81
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,840
arterial guide wire, occlusion balloon,

82
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:06,242
and 20 cc of saline, stat.

83
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,734
- What's he doing?
- I have no idea.

84
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:33,536
Well, you don't have one,
so I'm making a REBOA.

85
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:34,904
A what?

86
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,508
A REBOA.

87
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:40,777
Is that even a word?

88
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,846
A REBOA will occlude the damaged artery

89
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,047
and stop the bleeding.

90
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,868
Release the pressure.

91
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:13,209
BP is stabilizing. 90 over 60.

92
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,416
Nice work, Dr. Murphy.

93
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:20,984
I made a REBOA.

94
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,889
- Oxygen is dropping to 89.
- All right. Light.

95
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,544
Open wide for me.

96
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,469
Throat's swollen from smoke inhalation.

97
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:30,760
Cric kit.

98
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:33,530
- Do you see soot in her mouth or nose?
- No.

99
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,465
She doesn't need a cric.
She needs an escharotomy.

100
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:49,089
Sats are going back up. 92 and rising.

101
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,880
Circumferential neck burns.

102
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,706
The shrinking charred skin
is acting like a noose.

103
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:56,186
Escharotomy relieves the constriction.

104
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,987
Are you getting enough air now, ma'am?

105
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,823
Yes. Thank you.

106
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,257
Now get her out of this petri dish

107
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,493
and into an isolation ward
in the burn unit ASAP.

108
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,727
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:09,099
Your heart's a bit muffled.

110
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,567
Am I having a heart attack?

111
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,368
No, but it's not completely good news.

112
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,636
Cardiac tamponade.

113
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:15,004
He needs a pericardiocentesis.

114
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,606
Yes, I'm aware of that.

115
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:19,676
18-gauge and 55 cc syringe, please.

116
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,044
We need a FAST ultrasound in here.

117
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,245
They're both in use.

118
00:06:23,615 --> 00:06:25,448
You don't have imaging.
You could puncture his heart.

119
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,084
Is the xiphoid in the same place
as it was 20 years ago?

120
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:48,738
A REBOA.

121
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,206
Ballsy.

122
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,407
Could've gone really wrong.

123
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,795
Yes, well, it didn't.

124
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,745
It's a cowboy move...

125
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,948
something you would never
even dream of trying.

126
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,884
How many times is Shaun gonna
have to prove himself

127
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,280
before you give him a shot?

128
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,931
<i>Dr. Rolendez, O.R. 6.</i>

129
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,731
What happened in the E.R.?

130
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,766
Swan girl came in and you hesitated.

131
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:19,302
I wasn't hesitating.
I was thinking of a game plan.

132
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,404
Murphy was thinking of the game plan.

133
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,106
You got overwhelmed.

134
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,140
I wasn't.

135
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,209
First trauma... it happens.

136
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,479
You have to think clearly,
quickly, methodically.

137
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,347
You need to think
a little more like Shaun.

138
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,852
A <i>little</i> more. Not identically.

139
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,804
How you doing?

140
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:56,739
Sorry.

141
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,508
Sorry. That's a stupid question.

142
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,780
You're maxed out on morphine.

143
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,847
I'll hold off until it reloads.

144
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,889
How bad is it?

145
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,191
We're making good progress.

146
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:18,228
I'll have to, uh, debride
any deroofed blisters

147
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,629
to prevent a secondary
nosocomial and then...

148
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,397
I need a mirror.

149
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,765
It's the least you can do

150
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,368
since you can't even look me in the eye.

151
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,751
Oh, my God.

152
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:56,666
Do you know how many hideous
$300 bridesmaid dresses

153
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:59,409
I've had to buy in the last two years?

154
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:03,542
I decided that when I got married,

155
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,909
my bridesmaids are gonna wear
black cocktail dresses

156
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:09,846
so they can use them again, you know?

157
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,376
But now...

158
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,148
now I-I'm Freddy Krueger.

159
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,493
Who's gonna want to marry this?

160
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm gonna find a nurse,

161
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,099
have her adjust your, uh...
your morphine drip.

162
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,386
Okay.

163
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:39,409
You hit your face.

164
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,177
Your jaw got stuck. It hurts.

165
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,945
So, this shot I just gave you
is gonna knock you out

166
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,113
so that I can fix that.

167
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,515
Hang tight.

168
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,817
- Crash patients status check?
- 23 people total.

169
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,852
One fatality on site,
lost one in the E.R.

170
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,154
Examined all the red tags.

171
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,156
Got 13 yellow and green
still in the waiting room.

172
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,391
- I'll take whoever's up next.
- Marco Magallenes...

173
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:57,393
severed femoral artery, crushed femur.

174
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:00,463
I did the REBOA and then
installed a temporary shunt.

175
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,199
Here are his CT and MRI results.

176
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:10,206
Find someone else for whoever's up next.

177
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,509
Oh, finally.

178
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,663
Excuse me. Are you Marco's family?

179
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,231
Yes.

180
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,501
We just found out that my cousin
didn't survive the accident.

181
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,311
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,873
- It's a bit much.
- I'm so sorry.

183
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,676
I'm Dr. Melendez,
and this is Dr. Murphy.

184
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,144
I'm Ricardo.

185
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:50,113
I'm M-Marco's father.

186
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:54,016
This is, uh, his mother, Lorena,
and this is Sonia.

187
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,119
They were getting married tonight.

188
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:57,587
How's my son?

189
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,155
Marco's femur was completely shattered,

190
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,591
and his lower leg
isn't getting enough blood.

191
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,827
Can you save his leg?

192
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,296
Marco suffered
too much bone fragmentation.

193
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,362
We can't fix it.

194
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,901
Our only choice is to amputate.

195
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,589
<i>Mija.</i>

196
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:29,585
Bay Five needs a grade three hyphema.

197
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,187
Head CT and page ophthalmology?

198
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,267
You read my mind.

199
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,668
Been a while.

200
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,437
How you holding up
pulling an all-nighter?

201
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,540
I'll manage, but if you
can find me a caffeine IV,

202
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,141
- Please move!
- it'd be helpful.

203
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,046
- Tough night.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,195
Thanks for coming.

205
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,881
It's part of the job.

206
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,284
So, when's the big day?

207
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,920
Uh, we haven't set it yet.

208
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,388
Oh, where is it gonna be?

209
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,924
We'll figure it out.

210
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:57,559
Maybe a beach somewhere.

211
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,060
We should talk about this later.

212
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,629
What? I like beaches.

213
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:03,131
If you have a more romantic idea...

214
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,333
My family likes churches.

215
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,814
We should talk about this later.

216
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,041
Dr. Lim, I think one of your
yellows is about to turn red.

217
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,176
Hey.

218
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:17,379
I've got my wedding all planned out.

219
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,948
I've got the dress,
and I've got the flowers.

220
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,783
All I need is a groom.

221
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:25,320
You available, Dr. Murphy?

222
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:26,688
No.

223
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,723
You don't want some love?

224
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,860
No. No, I don't. I don't want love.

225
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:38,577
Dr. Glassman, neural consult, bay three.

226
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:40,430
Thank you.

227
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,573
Hey!

228
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,008
I was here first.

229
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,862
Shaun.

230
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,566
Shaun!

231
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,313
My patient's scans are very important.

232
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,882
Well, my patient's important, too.

233
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,847
I need to see my patient's scans.

234
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:58,520
Is your patient pre-op or post-op?

235
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:00,613
Pre-op.

236
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:02,390
Okay, I'll give you the computer,

237
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,992
but you need to apologize first.

238
00:13:03,994 --> 00:13:05,994
Okay, I'm sorry. Turn it on.

239
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,736
Why was Marco's family
crying when Dr. Melendez

240
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:18,072
told them his leg would
need to be amputated?

241
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,609
Well, their son's leg
is about to be cut off.

242
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:24,546
It's sad. Crying is normal.

243
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:27,115
But when your options
are amputation or death,

244
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:28,883
amputation is good news.

245
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:31,920
People need time to adjust
to big changes.

246
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,923
Marco's family didn't even get
a chance to pray for a miracle.

247
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,527
Mm. It's not possible.

248
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:50,071
The bone damage is too severe.

249
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,376
A rod implantation won't work.

250
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,462
There's nothing to anchor into,

251
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,544
and the shunt won't last long enough

252
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,838
to do reconstruction.

253
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,382
There are no other options.

254
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,822
What if we could replace
the entire femur?

255
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,094
We're making him a new femur.

256
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,527
With a 3D printer?

257
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,689
3D-printed bones have only successfully

258
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,901
- been done with the mandible.
- We know.

259
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,847
- That's a fairly small bone.
- We know.

260
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,932
A femur has to support
the weight of the entire body.

261
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:26,457
This one will be titanium. It can work.

262
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,928
It's an interesting idea...

263
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,905
but I need to think on it.

264
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:33,598
Right now we still got seven
yellow tags waiting.

265
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,966
What do you have to think about?

266
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,701
- It's a good idea.
- It's a brilliant idea.

267
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,349
The kid has brilliant ideas.
That doesn't mean...

268
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,538
No, it was my idea,
and I'm aware of the risks...

269
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,574
infection, clotting, hardware failure...

270
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:43,675
Death.

271
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:45,710
- It wasn't your idea.
- It was my idea!

272
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,733
And the risks are significant,
but isn't that their call?

273
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:50,600
- Don't we have to...
- Maybe he said something,

274
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,132
and then you said something,
and together, you...

275
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,818
My idea. Completely my idea.

276
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,788
The "brilliant" idea
is 100% my brilliant idea.

277
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,323
Why is that a problem for you?

278
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:01,292
Maybe because I've known you
for six months.

279
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,328
Every day we learn new things.

280
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,630
Today, you learned I'm brilliant.

281
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,998
The idea was brilliant.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,633
And it was mine.

283
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:12,047
And if anyone can do this
brilliant surgery, it's you.

284
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,508
Flattery...

285
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,128
also brilliant.

286
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:25,797
Sleeping on the job?

287
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:28,562
Just needed some fresh air.

288
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:30,922
Feels like I'm suffocating in there.

289
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:35,193
She's in pain, spilling her guts out,

290
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:38,006
and every time I open my mouth,
I sound like an idiot.

291
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:41,512
Dr. Kalu... unable to talk to women.

292
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:42,634
There's a first.

293
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,836
If you're not gonna be helpful,
Claire, just leave.

294
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,871
You don't need to talk.
Just listen to her.

295
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,322
You get to come out here,
clear your head.

296
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:57,664
She's trapped in there, alone
with her thoughts, her fears.

297
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,861
You don't think she wants to get out?

298
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,556
<i>You</i> are her escape.

299
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:12,611
You want to put a fake femur
into Marco's leg?

300
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:14,499
It's not fake. It's real.

301
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,095
It's not a real bone.
We're making it out of titanium.

302
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,370
- It's still real.
- That's incredible.

303
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:22,064
And Marco will be able
to walk, run, climb?

304
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:23,825
And swim.

305
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:26,239
Hopefully. That's the intention.

306
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:28,934
Well, have you done the surgery before?

307
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,882
- I haven't.
- We'll be the first.

308
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:34,786
Well, nobody has ever attempted
this surgery

309
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,454
with a bone as large as the femur.

310
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:39,257
I believe it's a viable option,
but there are risks.

311
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,960
Risks? Could Marco die?

312
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,062
In my estimation, there's a 10% chance

313
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:45,830
- he won't make it.
- Then no.

314
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,265
I'm not losing my son.

315
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:50,068
Wait. If there's a chance
we can save Marco's leg,

316
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,803
we should at least
discuss this some more.

317
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:52,870
That's what he'd want.

318
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:54,238
He'd want to live.

319
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,264
He'd want to have a life.

320
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:57,787
I know him.

321
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,510
He'd want to take the chance.

322
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,679
I will never forgive myself
if Marco died

323
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,619
because I made a reckless decision.

324
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,784
Whose decision is this?

325
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:08,665
Does he have a healthcare proxy?

326
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:10,254
I don't know what that is.

327
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,008
When the accident happened,

328
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:14,016
were you on the way to your
wedding or on the way back?

329
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,094
We were headed <i>to</i> the wedding.

330
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,610
Marco's parents are the next of kin.

331
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,864
They decide.

332
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:27,983
Please...

333
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:30,141
amputate our son's leg.

334
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,980
Murphy.

335
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,661
Why is the primary closure on the stump

336
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,483
so vital in amputation surgery?

337
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,530
For a proper prosthetic fitting.

338
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,077
Why are you marrying Jessica?

339
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,711
Why does anyone get married?

340
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:55,559
I don't know.

341
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,084
I love her.

342
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,755
I don't understand why
having someone to love

343
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,723
is so important to everyone.

344
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,193
You have to stand down.

345
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,971
- You can't amputate Marco's leg.
- Why not?

346
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:12,168
I filed an emergency injunction
to stop the surgery.

347
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,771
You were in a car accident.

348
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,706
Your neck was punctured.

349
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,374
The repair surgery went well.

350
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,776
You're gonna have to stay put for a week

351
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:25,278
before we can release you.

352
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,380
You're very lucky to be alive.

353
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,517
My wife, Jenna Hensel... is she okay?

354
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,570
Can I see her?

355
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,574
She's not listed.

356
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,175
That's a good thing.

357
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:51,421
She's probably still
in the waiting room.

358
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,223
I'll find her and bring her up.

359
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:55,268
She'll be relieved to know you're okay.

360
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,806
Okay.

361
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,529
What the hell am I supposed to do with

362
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:00,597
an unconscious patient

363
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,965
whose leg is a ticking time bomb?

364
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,133
Judge Singh is en route.

365
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:04,601
She wants to hear from both parties

366
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,935
and the doctors on the case.

367
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,596
I have to testify?

368
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,753
- Hopefully not.
- Hopefully not.

369
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,478
I thought you would be happy.

370
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:12,142
You thought you could save the leg,

371
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:14,010
and I didn't want that not
happening because the parents

372
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,145
are afraid to make a tough call.

373
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,746
It's their call to make.

374
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,581
And if the accident
happened an hour later,

375
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,949
it would be the wife's.

376
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,584
And she wants the fake leg.

377
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:23,420
It's not fake.

378
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:24,554
I thought you didn't believe

379
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,656
in just blindly following protocol.

380
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,824
He's their son.

381
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,526
Nobody's gonna love him more than them.

382
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:30,493
Seriously?

383
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,395
All parents love all children

384
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,596
more than anybody else?

385
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,765
People get divorced all the time.

386
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,200
How often do they give up their kids?

387
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:38,601
So, if this was us,

388
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:40,337
you'd want your parents
to decide over me?

389
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,172
- I didn't say that.
- You kind of did.

390
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,209
I was saying, there needs to be rules,

391
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,478
that there needs to be
bright red lines telling us

392
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,380
who gets to make these calls.

393
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:52,015
It's the parents' call.

394
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,583
Not anymore.

395
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,552
Now it's the judge's.

396
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,754
How much time does Marco have
left on the temporary shunt?

397
00:19:57,756 --> 00:19:59,823
Three hours,

398
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,458
and then his leg will die.

399
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,096
- Okay.
- Mm.

400
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,089
Dr. Torture returns.

401
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,729
Thought I'd scared you off for good.

402
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,811
Pick a movie.

403
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:24,637
You deserve to get out of this
room for a little while, too.

404
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:30,080
You think "Groundhog Day"
is gonna make a difference?

405
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:33,908
"I'm torturing you, but, hey,
you get to watch a funny movie."

406
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:36,493
That is sort of what
I was going for, yeah.

407
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,031
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,250
I wish there was something else
I could do.

409
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,872
How do you know there isn't?

410
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,640
This is protocol.
This is what they teach us.

411
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,253
I lucked out.

412
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:55,455
I got the world's greatest
expert on burn victims?

413
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:58,148
You know everything that can be done.

414
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:05,121
He loves to rock-climb,
scuba dive, bungee-jump.

415
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,664
This is insane.

416
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,226
His leg is literally dying
while we sit here reminiscing.

417
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,133
Please. We're trying to figure
out what your son would want.

418
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,064
- He would want to live.
- I want that, too,

419
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,246
but if there's a way that
we can save Marco's leg,

420
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:19,901
he'd want me to do it.

421
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,957
<i>Mija.</i> Do you know what
he wanted most of all?

422
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,407
He wanted to marry you.

423
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,881
He wanted to spend his life with
you, have children with you.

424
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,743
Now, he can do all that.

425
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:37,587
He can be happy with a prosthetic leg.

426
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:41,387
He's young, and he's strong.

427
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,030
<i>Mija,</i> he can get through this.

428
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:52,432
- When we met...
- I don't care about your stories.

429
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:56,739
I don't care that you met rock-climbing

430
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:58,508
or kayaking or whatever.

431
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,352
- I just want...
- We met in rehab.

432
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,477
Hey, are either of you Jenna Hensel?

433
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,001
I haven't seen Jenna

434
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:17,126
since we took pictures at the hotel.

435
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,595
But she got on the bus?

436
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,730
Yeah, she was sitting with Noomi.

437
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:28,771
I think she's still out there.

438
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,773
- Hey, guys! We've got to go back.
- Where?

439
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,709
To the crash site. Now.

440
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,411
He never wanted you to know.

441
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,482
He's an addict.

442
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,716
He replaced one addiction for
another one... a healthier one.

443
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,935
- But he needs...
- What?

444
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,380
He needs to wakeboard or
he'll drink himself to death?

445
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:50,860
This is ridiculous.

446
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,228
No, it's not!

447
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,997
We talked about it a lot.

448
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,332
It's pretty much all you do in rehab.

449
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,736
Marco has clarity for
the first time in his life.

450
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:01,371
He knows what makes him happy.

451
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:03,547
He knows his weaknesses.

452
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:06,406
He's not as strong as you think.

453
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,750
And that's okay, but...

454
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,488
Marco cheated on you.

455
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,409
It was about a month ago.

456
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,816
He was overwhelmed with
the wedding and the planning.

457
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,050
He ran into an ex-girlfriend.

458
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,914
It only happened once.

459
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:27,899
You're lying.

460
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:31,334
You're upset that he
had secrets from you, so...

461
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:33,169
No, she's not lying.

462
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,410
<i>Mija,</i> he... he was... he was so upset.

463
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:39,776
He does love you.

464
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,878
Okay, maybe we're digressing
here a little bit.

465
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,513
And we really don't have the time.

466
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,453
It matters.

467
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,609
She doesn't know him like...

468
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:51,859
maybe none of us do, but...

469
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:56,785
but we are his parents,
and you're not his wife.

470
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:58,412
Yet.

471
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,912
Okay. Get the cops. Check everywhere...

472
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,747
other side of the road, bushes, trees.

473
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,582
If she was ejected from the bus,
she could be 40, 50 feet

474
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,351
in any direction.

475
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,067
Jenna!

476
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,645
I found her! I need some help!

477
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,302
Okay, she's got a brain bleed.

478
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,327
We need to get her out of here now!

479
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:46,532
Dr. Andrews.

480
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:47,766
I think Celez may be eligible

481
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:49,735
for an experimental bone treatment.

482
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:50,802
Sell it to me.

483
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:52,271
Well, I've been doing some digging.

484
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:54,473
San Diego Community Hospital's burn unit

485
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,542
has been following
a Brazilian hospital's protocol

486
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,243
to wrap burns in tilapia skins.

487
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,913
Now... Now, I know fish skins
sound a bit crazy,

488
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,782
but... but I was thinking we
could do the same thing here.

489
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,569
Dr. Kalu, I applaud
your thinking. But we...

490
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,688
Tilapia skins contain
more collagen proteins...

491
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,872
both types 1 and 3...
than even human skin,

492
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,203
which aids in tissue repair,
negating the need for grafts.

493
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:15,787
- It's shown to accelerate healing,
- Dr. Kalu. Dr. Kalu.

494
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:17,229
would reduce the risk
of infection and cut down on

495
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:18,701
the patient's physical pain.

496
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,873
Are you finished, or would
you like to cut me off again?

497
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,536
Okay, let's follow this
through, shall we?

498
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:25,938
You have to come up with a proposal

499
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,172
for the experimental treatment,

500
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:29,508
get it approved by our
institutional review board,

501
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,288
get your hands
on medical-grade tilapia skins,

502
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,269
and then we...

503
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,157
Well, I thought you could help
expedite the process.

504
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:40,185
You think I could bring it down
from three months to two hours?

505
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:44,090
You finish the debridement?

506
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:46,124
Okay, I'll take over from here.

507
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,761
- Okay.
- Hey.

508
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:49,962
Keep thinking outside the box.

509
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,697
Initiative is good.

510
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,041
I'm in. Bag her.

511
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:04,209
Did you get me the drill?

512
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,644
The fire truck had one. What's going on?

513
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,678
Her pupil's blown.

514
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,946
She has a subdural hematoma,

515
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,581
causing increased intracranial pressure.

516
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,983
If I don't alleviate it now,

517
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,884
there's no way she makes it
to the hospital alive.

518
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,121
Okay.

519
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,878
Unconscious female. Flail chest.

520
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,513
I had to do a burr hole in field.

521
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,448
Her sats are in the low 70s.

522
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,092
She's good to go to the O.R.

523
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,464
Subdural hematoma?

524
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,503
She had decerebrate posturing,
a blown left pupil.

525
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,128
When I passed the drill bit
through her skull,

526
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,784
a whole lot of blood pooled out.

527
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:04,175
Good call.

528
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:11,376
Uh, San Diego Community Hospital called.

529
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,878
They're sending the tilapia skins.

530
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,513
They're medevacing them in.

531
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,648
Should be here within the hour.

532
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,340
Celez...

533
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,286
you meet the criteria
for an experimental treatment

534
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:24,277
that I think will prevent you
from having to undergo skin grafts.

535
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:26,588
Hold up. How did this even happen?

536
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,370
Well, I found out San Diego's trial

537
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:30,429
allows for multi-site collaborations.

538
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,631
So, there's no need for us
to get our own I.R.B.

539
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:35,767
They give us the skins,
we provide the patient data.

540
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,469
Fish skins?

541
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:39,871
The tilapia skins have been
cleaned and sterilized.

542
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:42,140
They're perfectly safe.

543
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,812
You'll do it?

544
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,516
I'll do it.

545
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:55,568
Well done, Dr. Kalu.

546
00:27:55,778 --> 00:27:57,444
Well done.

547
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,257
...so help you God?

548
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:01,156
Yes.

549
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:04,250
- Dr. Melendez can tell you...
- He has.

550
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:07,232
But the fake femur is yours,
though, right?

551
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:09,768
- How confident are you in its design?
- It's not fake!

552
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,204
- Shaun, she needs to know...
- I know what she needs to know.

553
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,473
She needs to know will it work.

554
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:17,275
She needs to know how long it will last.

555
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,212
Yes.

556
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:21,613
Okay.

557
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:29,087
He's his doctor?

558
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:31,256
He is a surgical resident.
He's very gifted.

559
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:33,074
Is he going to answer my questions?

560
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:36,129
Shaun, I really need you to focus.

561
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,851
- Marco is running out of time!
- Just let him answer!

562
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:44,010
No, we already know the answer.
They don't know.

563
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:45,578
This thing has never been done before.

564
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,169
Be quiet!

565
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:57,287
His toes are changing color.

566
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:08,624
He's clotting. That's bad.
Page Dr. Melendez stat!

567
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:12,344
- Murphy, what do we got?
- The shunt is clotting.

568
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,437
It's restricting blood flow.
It is failing.

569
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,728
All right, we need a decision now.

570
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,386
Are we cutting off the leg
or replacing the bone?

571
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,221
There's no doubt in my mind
that Marco's parents

572
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:22,125
and fiancée all love Marco,
but it's become clear...

573
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:23,772
Now. I need a decision now.

574
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:28,053
His parents know him as their child.

575
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:30,322
Sonia knows him as a man.

576
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:32,774
Replace the femur.

577
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,907
Let's go!

578
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,922
Thank you! Thank you.

579
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:48,874
- And there's the bleed. See it?
- Yes, sir.

580
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,933
You ever clip
an intracranial artery before?

581
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:53,824
No, sir.

582
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:55,147
Go for it.

583
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:05,151
Just like every first time...

584
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:09,395
you're a little excited,
a little nauseous.

585
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,753
Hopefully nobody gets hurt.

586
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:31,884
Is it good to go?

587
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:33,285
It's very good.

588
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:34,253
Forceps.

589
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:41,627
You ready?

590
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,028
Yes.

591
00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:17,229
Be careful the clip blades don't catch

592
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,809
any perforated arteries.

593
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:22,067
I don't seen any vessels in the way.

594
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:23,702
Then what are you waiting for?

595
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,209
Very nice.

596
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:31,276
Thank you.

597
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:36,648
Everything's dry.

598
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,584
Say goodbye and close the roof.

599
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:42,755
We need to get blood back into his leg

600
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:44,656
in the next minute or so,

601
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,892
or I'm gonna have to amputate after all.

602
00:31:46,894 --> 00:31:49,528
Insulin's hanging,
loaded him with calcium.

603
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,763
Best I can do.

604
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:52,131
Let's release the clamps.

605
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,602
Check for capillary refill.

606
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:11,388
Blood flow is restored.

607
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:14,286
EKG is normal.

608
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:18,891
Okay. Kim, I want to hear words like

609
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,160
"variability" and "Delta".

610
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:22,694
Give them to me.

611
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,973
I'm waiting patiently.

612
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,723
I'm not getting anything.

613
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,701
Show me.

614
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,746
Check the leads.

615
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:49,521
Still nothing.

616
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,534
Maybe there will be
some neuroplasticity.

617
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:55,128
Her brain... i-it could rewire itself.

618
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:57,396
No.

619
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,933
Zero brain activity.

620
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,138
I don't know why, but she's gone.

621
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,967
What?

622
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,902
Your neurosurgery patient
that died tonight...

623
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:25,371
there's something you should know.

624
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:26,759
What?

625
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,968
Now, Marco, I want you
to try and move your toes.

626
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:49,995
I can't.

627
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:51,797
- Is he okay?
- We're not sure if the bone...

628
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,062
He's not gonna die?

629
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:54,585
H-He's not gonna get an infection?

630
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,036
- His body's not gonna reject...
- No, no. We're monitoring him very closely.

631
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,038
- The biggest threat is behind...
- He moved.

632
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,273
He moved.

633
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,032
It worked.

634
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:12,151
You'll have a long recovery ahead...

635
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:13,867
months of physical therapy.

636
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:15,535
But for now, all you have to do is rest.

637
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,356
Thank you.

638
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,178
Thank you for saving my life...
for saving my leg.

639
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

640
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:31,170
Are you ready to finish what we started?

641
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,414
Get well first.

642
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,810
There's plenty of time for a wedding.

643
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,187
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

644
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,421
Thank you.

645
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:58,130
You look good.

646
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:00,811
Tough. Like Aquaman.

647
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:06,551
Mm. I look like sushi.

648
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,474
Everybody loves sushi.

649
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,243
It's only for six months.

650
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,546
Your new skin should have
completely grown in by then.

651
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,054
Should have minor scarring.

652
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,783
Thank you.

653
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,887
I misjudged you.

654
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,623
You judged me just right.

655
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,856
Is she still sleeping?

656
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,240
You haven't told her yet?

657
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,638
No.

658
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,855
Can I have a moment please?

659
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:47,713
Of course.

660
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:57,419
How soon after you found
Jenna at the crash site

661
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:59,193
did you intubate her?

662
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,982
Almost immediately.

663
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:02,849
I did a sternal rub.

664
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,530
Uh, she had decerebrate posturing.

665
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:06,265
Her left pupil was blown.

666
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,966
I knew she had a subdural hematoma,

667
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:10,803
so I intubated, did the burr hole.

668
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,489
She also had a flail chest.

669
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:16,041
Did you check her breathing
after you intubated her?

670
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,209
Yes.

671
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,080
Well, at least I-I think I did.

672
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:28,387
Dr. Lim told me that when
Jenna came into the E.R.,

673
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,289
she wasn't ventilating properly.

674
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,378
You inserted the tube too deep

675
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:35,058
into her right main stem bronchus

676
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:37,222
of her injured lung.

677
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:39,341
We had no way of knowing

678
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:43,372
how long she was hypoxic
before we gave her the EEG.

679
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:57,916
I drilled a perfect
burr hole into her skull

680
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:59,518
on the side of the road
in the middle of the night,

681
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,568
and I-I-I screw up her intubation?

682
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:03,825
Yes.

683
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:07,053
It was tough conditions
for anyone... resident or not.

684
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,661
Any one of us could have
made the same mistake.

685
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:27,279
I had a woman come into the E.R. once...

686
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:31,448
...a mother, 51 years old.

687
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:34,379
Francine Parker.

688
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,691
She had two boys.

689
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:38,964
She had a cough...

690
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:42,684
a bad one... but a cough.

691
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:46,064
I checked her out, gave her some
antibiotics, sent her home.

692
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:49,386
Six hours later,
she was rolled into the E.R.

693
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,527
She had had a heart attack,
and I missed it, and...

694
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:55,602
she died.

695
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:03,654
Not one day... goes by
when I don't think about her.

696
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,100
She was your first.

697
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:11,623
My fourth, actually.

698
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,526
You're not gonna forget this.

699
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,057
You never forget.

700
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,034
But I don't know, maybe
we're better off for it

701
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:24,159
the next time around.

702
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,272
You got to find a way to keep going.

703
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,595
Yeah.

704
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:35,330
Go home. Get some rest.

705
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:37,015
I haven't even told her yet.

706
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,317
You're not going to.

707
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,487
You made a mistake.
You're too close to this.

708
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,656
I'm not gonna allow you
to talk to the family

709
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:48,727
or anyone else outside
this hospital about this.

710
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,744
Do we understand each other?

711
00:38:53,233 --> 00:38:54,705
Yes, sir.

712
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:30,769
I called San Diego Community
Hospital and thanked them

713
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,004
for including us in their study.

714
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:34,142
They said they were happy to do it.

715
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:38,120
And they asked that I pass along
their thanks to you

716
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:42,014
for your very generous donation
to their burn unit.

717
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:48,186
I know you come from a wealthy family.

718
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:50,541
I don't begrudge that, but you...

719
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:54,367
can't open your wallet
every time a patient's in need.

720
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:58,680
The lines can get real blurry real fast.

721
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:02,884
Yes, sir.

722
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,202
What's this?

723
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,119
My healthcare proxy.

724
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,959
Jess, nothing's gonna happen.

725
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,963
Really? That's good to know.

726
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:08,241
Well, that was quite a night.

727
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,085
Been a doctor for a long while...

728
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:13,710
don't remember a night
quite like that one.

729
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,358
Why did Nurse Farrar ask
if I wanted love?

730
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,478
'Cause she's a nosy...

731
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:24,911
Shaun, you really don't want love?

732
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,419
I loved Steve and my rabbit.

733
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,489
Not anymore.

734
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,087
You don't love them anymore?

735
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,353
No, I don't. They're dead.

736
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,759
You can't love someone if they're dead.

737
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,691
Well, I've lost people I love.

738
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,027
I miss them, and it hurts,
but I still love them.

739
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:54,068
I don't want love.

740
00:41:58,551 --> 00:41:59,885
Okay.

741
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,349
You want breakfast?

742
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,768
Can I have four pancakes
instead of three?

743
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,359
You can have five.

744
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:13,268
I only want four.

745
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,338
Okay.

746
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,354
Okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
