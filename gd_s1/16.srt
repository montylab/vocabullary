1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,352
My neighbor Kenny and his
girlfriend go all the time.

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,588
The rides were actually fun, Claire,

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,024
even though they hurl you
through the air very quickly

4
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:13,326
without a proper three-point seatbelt.

5
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:15,828
It was worth the $300 I spent.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,664
What kind of carnival
will cost you that much money?

7
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,766
It was not just the carnival.

8
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:23,002
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to
go to see a movie afterwards,

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,971
but I just got the second edition

10
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:27,040
of Chaikof's "Atlas of Vascular Therapy"

11
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,408
so decided not to go.

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,642
And you paid for everyone?

13
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,244
I had to. I lost the bet.

14
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:33,479
Rounds will have to wait.
We have a consult come up.

15
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,114
Hunter Denoble, 38...

16
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,617
Came into the E.R. this morning
complaining of severe neck pain.

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,519
X-rays show anterolisthesis.

18
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,754
A herniated disc... 38 a little
young for that, isn't it?

19
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:44,390
Unless there's a history
of spinal trauma.

20
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:45,591
There is.

21
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,894
Hunter fractured seven vertebrae
in his neck and back

22
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,662
in a motorcycle accident 10 years ago.

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,161
He's one of my first patients...

24
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,900
suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

25
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,269
...A few months back, just gnawing pain.

26
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,504
Ibuprofen usually took the edge off.

27
00:00:58,506 --> 00:00:59,973
Every day?

28
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:02,575
Uh, yeah, give or take.

29
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,210
It's not that bad.

30
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,511
Last night things changed.

31
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,013
He couldn't move his neck at all,

32
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:08,715
and the pain medicine had no effect.

33
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:11,751
So, he wanted to tough it out,
but I dragged him in here.

34
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:12,986
Yeah, it sounds like you.

35
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:14,320
Feel that?

36
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,388
Yeah.

37
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,689
- And that?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:18,524
I made partner at the firm.

39
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:20,426
I don't like to call in sick.

40
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:21,894
And let's face it, I've spent

41
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,397
enough nights in hospital rooms
for five lifetimes.

42
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:26,165
Can't argue with that.

43
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,201
Squeeze my hands.

44
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,537
You have any tingling
or weakness in your arms?

45
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,872
No.

46
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,608
The plain films showed what
looked like a herniated disc...

47
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,878
which would mean...?

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,413
Artificial disc replacement...

49
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:44,517
Day procedure, he'd be out
by the morning at the latest.

50
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,586
You married him?

51
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:51,958
Yes, three years ago in Cancún.
It was lovely.

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,360
Even though he's in a wheelchair?

53
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,895
- Shaun.
- Oh, no worries.

54
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,830
I get this all the time.

55
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:00,166
Sure, she can never wear heels,
but think of the parking.

56
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,469
What happened?

57
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,238
Pain shot right down through my legs.

58
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,473
- Your legs?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,876
I haven't felt anything
below my chest in 10 years.

60
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,644
What the hell is going on?

61

Mom.

70
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,462
Well, there's my girl.

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,934
I don't want to see you.

72
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,769
But I haven't seen you in years.

73
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,270
Don't run away from me.

74
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:13,573
- Can we talk?
- Since I don't want to see you,

75
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:16,109
it follows that I don't want to
hear from you, either.

76
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,779
I just came in to get antibiotics.

77
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,614
My surgeon doesn't work on Fridays.

78
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,649
It feels fine.

79
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,451
Sorry, it's not fine.

80
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,587
This implant is definitely infected.

81
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,455
Just that one, though, right?

82
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:30,923
Yes. At this point,

83
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,393
your butt lift, tummy tuck,
lipo, and breast augmentation

84
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,896
appear to be healthy.

85
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:40,199
But I need to remove this one
and clean the area

86
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,467
before the bacteria spreads.

87
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,236
Well, can you replace it?

88
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,871
Once the infection is resolved

89
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:46,439
and you have a few months to heal.

90
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:49,175
I don't want to walk around with
half of a face for a few months.

91
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:51,310
Isn't there anything you can do
to save the implant?

92
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,246
I can't make any guarantees,

93
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,681
but if I can replace the implant
without risking re-infection,

94
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:56,816
I will.

95
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,686
Okay, Doctor.

96
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:12,665
I didn't understand the lyrics,
but I liked your mom's voice.

97
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,035
Is she a professional singer?

98
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:19,105
She is a lot of things.

99
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,040
Great mom wasn't one of them.

100
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,808
How so?

101
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,711
A lot of people have issues
with their parents, nothing new.

102
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,915
But everyone's story's different.

103
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,785
How so?

104
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,723
When I was in high school,

105
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:40,359
I babysat the kids in my neighborhood.

106
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,361
I wanted to buy a laptop for school

107
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,564
like a lot of my friends had,

108
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:47,867
so I saved up 1,000 bucks.

109
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:49,635
I came home one day,

110
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:52,672
and the money was gone
and so was my mother.

111
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,775
And three days later,

112
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:58,277
she came back from Reno

113
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:03,316
with a designer dress
and a guy named Ricky.

114
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:06,586
I never got the laptop.

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,461
My mom made pancakes.

116
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,562
They were good.

117
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,866
Mm, what is that?

118
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,473
I've never seen anything like that.

119
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,375
Maybe a spinal column tumor.

120
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:31,844
Hunter's initial spinal cord injury

121
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,312
from the motorcycle accident

122
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:35,715
that caused his paralysis was at T1,

123
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:38,651
but that part looks
almost completely normal now.

124
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:44,824
Hunter's phantom pain is real.

125
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,528
My former mentor, Sonya Kung,

126
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,330
is head of the surgical
residency program

127
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,965
at Denver Memorial Hospital.

128
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,034
If you want a meeting,
I'll make the call.

129
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:57,303
Why?

130
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,605
You're gonna need a job after this year.

131
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,108
You just trying to screw with my head,

132
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,276
or are you actually being serious?

133
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,777
The opportunity is real.

134
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,046
I'm trying to be nice.

135
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,282
I do that when it doesn't hurt me.

136
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:11,517
And this definitely doesn't hurt you,

137
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,885
you getting rid of some competition.

138
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:17,623
True, although you're not high
on my list of threats.

139
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,959
This would be a much bigger
benefit for you.

140
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:22,061
Look, I fought to stay here.

141
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,530
I'm not going anywhere.

142
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,173
It's very rare, but after many years

143
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,475
with a bruised cord like yours
that isn't severed,

144
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:38,311
it can start to function again.

145
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,380
So, this mass is causing Hunter's pain?

146
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,481
Yes.

147
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,549
If the cord is healthy,

148
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,551
why aren't I feeling more than pain?

149
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,553
The mass is compressing
the healthy cord,

150
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:48,721
just letting the pain through.

151
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:50,356
We still have to do

152
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:52,458
some more advanced imaging
to map the mass,

153
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,827
but I am fairly confident

154
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,696
that if we removed it that could change.

155
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,400
You may be able to walk again.

156
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:10,735
We were able to clean out the infection

157
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:13,584
and swap in a new implant.
I am very pleased.

158
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:14,608
You think it looks okay?

159
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:18,129
I love it, and you are going to
look great at the beach.

160
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,899
Wailea?

161
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,169
We went there on our honeymoon.

162
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,971
Thank you.

163
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,172
Ooh.

164
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:30,141
He's taking you to Hawaii.
You should be hugging him.

165
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,571
Oh, I'm so relieved.

166
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,414
Satisfied customers...

167
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,417
This is why cosmetics
is the most fun specialty.

168
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,394
Now, we're gonna monitor you closely.

169
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,666
There is a risk

170
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,558
the infection could have seeded
to other implants.

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,175
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, Chief.

172
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,528
I'll take the early shift.

173
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:55,730
Once I'm on my feet,
I'm never sitting down again.

174
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:58,433
I'm gonna take Cora dancing.

175
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,602
She's a great dancer.

176
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:01,803
Oh, no.

177
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,404
I push myself.

178
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,873
No offense. It's my rule.

179
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:10,188
Right.

180
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,513
If this works,

181
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:15,249
after a considerable amount
of physical therapy

182
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,018
you may be able to walk,

183
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,554
but that doesn't mean
you'll be a very good dancer.

184
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,889
After years of atrophy
from not moving your legs,

185
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,391
you will likely be very bad.

186
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,263
You know what the worst part is?

187
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:30,798
It isn't being in the chair.

188
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,001
It's that people see the chair first.

189
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,569
They don't see me.

190
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:36,771
You know what I'm talking about.

191
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:39,207
Why would I know
what you're talking about?

192
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:41,175
My brother-in-law's on the spectrum.

193
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,577
So's my assistant.

194
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:45,046
I make it a priority of hiring
people with disabilities.

195
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,347
Let me guess...

196
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,582
When you first started working here,

197
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,484
- no one believed in you.
- They didn't know me.

198
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:52,153
They didn't know that I was
going to make a good surgeon.

199
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,821
No.

200
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,525
You were different.

201
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,260
I guarantee you every other doctor

202
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,262
started with a basic level of respect.

203
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:03,164
It's implied they're competent.

204
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,736
We waste our time and energy
trying to prove that we belong.

205
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:18,379
I'm fine.

206
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,448
She's just being thorough, honey.

207
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,617
You've been over my body three times.

208
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:24,786
Early infections often mimic blemishes.

209
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:26,554
It pays to be thorough.

210
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:28,656
Is this sore?

211
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,459
Maybe a little.

212
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:32,827
What's wrong?

213
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,228
It could be nothing,

214
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,432
or it could be a carbuncle,
an early sign of infection.

215
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:40,968
Dr. Andrews
needs to have a look at this.

216
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:48,776
This varicocele is raising
testicular temperature

217
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,912
and causing your sperm count to be low.

218
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:53,948
Surgically, I go in,
ligate the varicocele

219
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,983
and re-check your numbers
in a few weeks.

220
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,185
It's done under a local,

221
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:00,188
so no anesthesia risks,
minimal blood loss.

222
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,223
There's a risk of
low testosterone and impotence,

223
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:04,459
but recovery time's
usually a week at most.

224
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:10,832
So, I could have kids, I just
might not be able to make them?

225
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,800
As I said, it's low risk.

226
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:15,036
I only mention it because
I'm obligated to inform you.

227
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:17,638
Well, you're obligated to
inform me because it's a risk.

228
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,641
It's an unlikely complication,
but, yes, it happens.

229
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:21,976
It's outpatient.

230
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:23,978
I do it right here in the office.

231
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,116
What I see here
is a chance to fix a problem.

232
00:10:28,118 --> 00:10:30,017
And I see a chance to create a new one.

233
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,522
I'm... I'm sorry, I have to go.
I have a patient.

234
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,627
Look, I see a lot of men
with this issue.

235
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,662
Sure, they come in
because they want kids,

236
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:44,432
but I think what they really
want is to reaffirm themselves.

237
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,868
And that's a good thing.

238
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:49,470
Thank you.

239
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:55,276
It's a spinal arachnoid meningioma.

240
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:57,645
Have you seen one of these before?

241
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:58,980
Much smaller.

242
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,615
They usually don't get this big

243
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,816
because the pain and weakness

244
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:04,185
brings the patient into the E.R. fast.

245
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:05,953
But in this case, no pain,

246
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,755
no E.R. visit until it got this big.

247
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,257
And it's wrapped around
the spinal cord tightly

248
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,558
and fused with the dura.

249
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,760
Can we get a fiber-optic laser
and take it out in segments?

250
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:15,797
No, I don't think so.

251
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,634
It stopped growing
and settled in this position.

252
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,170
But I do think that we can dissect

253
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:23,871
along the subarachnoid plane

254
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:25,540
down to the largest segment at T2

255
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:26,908
and remove it in one piece.

256
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,243
That's an extension of the mass.

257
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,679
Mm, no. It's the medullary pyramids.

258
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,695
No. It's an extension of the mass.

259
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:40,121
The pyramids are more central
and the color is wrong.

260
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,290
Murphy's right.

261
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:45,893
The extension's tightly adhered
to the brainstem.

262
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,363
Who caught it?

263
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:51,566
Jared did.

264
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:52,867
Nice work.

265
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,535
Most first-year residents
would have missed this.

266
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:56,270
It's very small on the surface,

267
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,873
but I can feel the fluctuance
under the skin.

268
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,408
What do we need to do to fix it?

269
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:04,612
We need to remove all of the implants

270
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,114
and some of the healthy
underlying tissue as well.

271
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:10,852
Unfortunately, it will cause
significant permanent scarring.

272
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:12,720
No, no, no, you... you can't do that.

273
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,388
I'll look worse than I did before.

274
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,591
I-I don't get it. You removed
the bad part from her face,

275
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:19,427
and it's fixed...
looks good, no more infection.

276
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,128
Let's just do the same
with the rest of 'em.

277
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,897
It's not that simple.

278
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,899
When we removed the infection
from Emma's cheek,

279
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,602
it was under the pretense
it was a localized issue.

280
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,371
If we just take out
the infection from the new area,

281
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:32,106
it could jump again.

282
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:35,643
I won't do it.

283
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,279
When an infection spreads,
it often moves very quickly.

284
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,547
What Dr. Andrews is saying...

285
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,884
I understand what he's saying.

286
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:45,887
I'm 50 years old.

287
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,724
When I went to drop my daughter
off at Michigan,

288
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,426
we went to that bar on Liberty Street,

289
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,695
where we first met.

290
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:58,065
I saw myself sitting there
25 years ago...

291
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:01,903
young, confident, full of potential.

292
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:05,806
Then you raise a kid

293
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:12,179
and look after your husband, a home.

294
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,686
You lose touch with who you were.

295
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,824
You... you said it was
an infection, right?

296
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,660
Like strep throat or something.

297
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:28,629
That's what antibiotics are for.

298
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,431
Couldn't we just use that?

299
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:37,004
We could try strong,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

300
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:38,906
but I really don't want to do that.

301
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,641
You could become septic.

302
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:41,842
You could die.

303
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,619
It'll work. It has to.

304
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,424
The brainstem is complex.

305
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,160
Even our best imaging can't
provide a complete picture.

306
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:02,496
So, then, you would just
leave the cyst in him?

307
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,498
Other than the pain,
it's not harming Hunter.

308
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,167
It's stabilized now and done growing.

309
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,735
But what about the pain?

310
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:13,441
An implanted nerve inhibitor
will completely remove the pain.

311
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,776
But I won't be able to walk.

312
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:18,579
No.

313
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,822
Exactly how risky is removing
the mass from the brainstem?

314
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,323
Everything that keeps your heart beating

315
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,791
and you breathing is right there.

316
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,828
The nerve inhibitor is a day procedure.

317
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,030
You'd sleep in your bed tonight
pain-free.

318
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,231
Give me a percentage on this thing.

319
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,666
Don't do this to yourself.

320
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,201
I don't like to give
those kinds of numbers.

321
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:41,402
They're population-based,

322
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:42,870
and they don't apply to
your exact circumstance.

323
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:44,405
I understand how statistics work.

324
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,507
But there's a number, and it's relevant.

325
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:52,210
There's a 15% chance
the surgery would kill you.

326
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,282
I remember the moment I accepted
I'd never walk again.

327
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:06,619
It wasn't when Dr. Melendez
told me after the accident.

328
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:11,427
It was a few months later
when I was in rehab

329
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,727
and I was trying to
get up in the standing frame.

330
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,095
I looked out the window

331
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,165
and there's all these people
just living their lives.

332
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,270
I was trying to fix something
that I can't change,

333
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,684
and life was going on without me.

334
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,738
So I started living again.

335
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,488
But now there's something I can do.

336
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,112
Hunter...

337
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,562
I want to talk to Dr. Melendez.

338
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,083
No.

339
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:59,018
Please.

340
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,087
Just go get Dr. Melendez.

341
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,503
You curious?

342
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,805
About why I gave you the credit?

343
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,841
I assume you thought it was a set-up,

344
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:23,142
that Andrews thought you were wrong

345
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:24,643
and you tried to throw it on me.

346
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,359
That's very cynical.

347
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:30,316
The other alternative
is that you were being kind,

348
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,051
which seems very unlikely.

349
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,920
There is a third possibility.

350
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:36,789
I'm proving a point.

351
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,358
When you lose their respect,
no matter what you do,

352
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,893
no matter how many wins you chalk up,

353
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,862
you'll never get it back.

354
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:44,430
The game's already over.

355
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:46,711
You lost.

356
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:48,873
Does anyone like you?

357
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,636
I like me.

358
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,404
I've got results.

359
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,411
I know this is her first cycle
of antibiotics,

360
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,480
but I'm not seeing any improvement.

361
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,739
Her neutrophils are through the roof.

362
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,371
You'd be under anesthesia
for nine hours,

363
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:09,973
and I'll need to make sure that
your body's healthy enough

364
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,174
to handle the stress.

365
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,343
Will you tell him
not to do this, please?

366
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,779
You don't care what I think?

367
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm the one in the chair.

368
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:18,482
You have no idea what that's like.

369
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,317
I'm right there with you.

370
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,052
Who carries you up the stairs?

371
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:24,087
Who pushes you out through the sand

372
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,589
so you can put your feet in the water?

373
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,324
Well, this way you won't have to
do those things anymore.

374
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,992
So you just want to gamble
the life that you have

375
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,293
for the life that you had?

376
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:31,828
Cora.

377
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:36,500
We have a great life,

378
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,435
but I want to walk again...

379
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,604
and I want you to see me walk.

380
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,742
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you die.

381
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,411
If you want to selfishly
gamble your life away,

382
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,547
you're doing it on your own.

383
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:55,585
I'm doing this for us.

384
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:58,388
No, you're doing this for you.

385
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,668
She'll be back.

386
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,506
<i>Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics, please.</i>

387
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,041
<i>Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics.</i>

388
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,477
Hey. Uh, I got a page?

389
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:28,552
I'm busy, and I don't like being
tricked into coming down here.

390
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,687
- Yeah, I know you hate me...
- I don't hate you.

391
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,455
Seeing you is not healthy for me.

392
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:35,592
Okay, wait... Well, I just need
to tell you that I was sick.

393
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,631
I am sick.

394
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,500
I know, you've been telling me
that for years.

395
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,702
You were right.

396
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,637
I got help.

397
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,673
They have me on mood stabilizers.

398
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,975
I'm doing better now.

399
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,044
I mean, sometimes the meds
make me feel flat.

400
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,546
You know, no highs, no fun.

401
00:18:56,548 --> 00:18:57,914
No lows, though, either.

402
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,783
It's worth it.

403
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,719
I'd like to try again to be your mom.

404
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,158
I mean, maybe we could just
talk some more?

405
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:12,395
I'll think about it.

406
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,297
Well, take these.

407
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,666
They need water or they're gonna die.

408
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:19,870
My number's on the card.

409
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,851
I think I just won the Tour de France.

410
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:36,019
It's a long surgery.

411
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,388
It will put a lot of strain
on your heart.

412
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:44,728
Your cardiovascular fitness
is excellent.

413
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,330
Huh!

414
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,237
You get it, right?

415
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,273
Get what?

416
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,475
Why I want this surgery so bad.

417
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:01,344
You'd jump at a cure for autism,
wouldn't ya?

418
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,647
There isn't a cure for autism.

419
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:08,485
Well, last week I didn't think
there was a surgery to help me.

420
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:15,992
The surgery isn't guaranteed
to help you walk.

421
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:17,861
Why would you risk

422
00:20:17,863 --> 00:20:20,797
losing a person who accepts you
the way you are?

423
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,233
You may not find another one.

424
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:26,236
There are a lot of reasons
to marry me, you know?

425
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,306
I'm sure there are a lot of
reasons to marry you.

426
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:33,143
Yes. I'm organized, I have
excellent visual-spatial memory,

427
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:36,746
and Lea says I'm refreshingly
honest and fair.

428
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:42,752
I suppose Cora loves me
because I'm determined...

429
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:46,056
I'm pretty smart,

430
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,258
committed to helping others,

431
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,860
and most of all,
probably because I'm patient.

432
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:54,297
Were you always those things?

433
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,868
Were you those things before
you were in the wheelchair?

434
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,708
Your autism helped you...
That's your point.

435
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,043
You're saying this chair
made me a better person.

436
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:12,882
The difference is losing this chair now

437
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:16,786
won't make me lose the lessons
it gave me.

438
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:26,496
The antibiotics aren't working.

439
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:31,267
I told if they didn't
we'd be doing surgery next.

440
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:35,438
No.

441
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,743
She's going to die if we don't act now.

442
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,683
Honey, we need to listen to the doctors.

443
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,621
I need you to trust me.

444
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:56,593
I can't go back to being
like it used to be.

445
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:59,462
You don't have a choice.

446
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,904
She wants a second opinion.

447
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,806
She's going to die.

448
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,182
I told her that.

449
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:31,415
Sometimes it's tough to actually
get out of those doors.

450
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,548
When I was a kid,

451
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,350
my little sister had an accident
climbing a tree...

452
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:43,526
a traumatic brain injury...

453
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:47,590
and I woke up every morning
dreaming that she was better,

454
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,916
but she wasn't.

455
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,065
I took care of her a lot...

456
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,916
brushed her teeth,
combed her hair, fed her.

457
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:02,494
Hunter was my first patient
as an attending,

458
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:05,341
and I had to walk in that room
and tell him

459
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,425
that there was nothing
I could do for him,

460
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,960
nothing I could do to fix him.

461
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,199
And now there is?

462
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,557
But there's no guarantee.

463
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:20,268
There is never a guarantee.

464
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:30,279
I'm sorry, but I can't risk

465
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:33,451
losing the man that I fell in love with.

466
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:41,033
You're not just afraid that
the surgery will kill him.

467
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,425
You're afraid that it might work.

468
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:47,195
You've only known Hunter
in a wheelchair.

469
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:51,700
Walking would be a fundamental
change in who he is...

470
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:55,938
a fundamental change
in who you are as a couple.

471
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,606
You're worried that
no matter what happens,

472
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,441
you're gonna lose him.

473
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,513
Hunter seems to have a great life.

474
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:06,481
I don't know if I'd risk giving that up.

475
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:09,251
What if there was an operation
to make you a perfect doctor,

476
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:13,755
never make a mistake, but it had
a, you know, 5% of killing you?

477
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:14,957
Would you do it?

478
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,758
That's not a fair comparison.

479
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,227
Well, you said Hunter's
doing fine the way he is,

480
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:22,798
but we're talking about
giving him something more.

481
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,299
What about 2%?

482
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:27,402
I don't think there's a number for me.

483
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:28,737
Oh, of course there's a number.

484
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:30,505
Every time you get in your car...

485
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:31,707
Hell, every time you leave your home

486
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,308
you take a risk
something bad could happen.

487
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,710
But you do it anyway,

488
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,878
you know, to make yourself better,

489
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,814
to make the world better,

490
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:39,915
sometimes just to have fun.

491
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,250
Sometimes to go to a carnival.

492
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,286
Kenny's not your friend.

493
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,821
He's using you.

494
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:48,924
I... don't think so.

495
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:50,158
We have fun.

496
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,693
He's got a rap sheet.

497
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:53,195
Mostly misdemeanors,

498
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:55,197
but there's a couple felony theft cases

499
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,699
that were bargained down.

500
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,936
Wait, you ran a background check
on Kenny?

501
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:04,606
Well, you start by talking,
I start by gathering evidence.

502
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,843
I'll forward it to you.

503
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,926
In my experience,
there are only two reasons

504
00:25:24,928 --> 00:25:27,562
why a married person has
this kind of cosmetic surgery.

505
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:30,032
Either you're halfway
out the door or she is.

506
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,734
Emma loves me.

507
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:35,904
That's what I figured.

508
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:39,307
The antibiotics aren't working,

509
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,777
so your wife is going to die

510
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,578
unless you get in there
and you convince her

511
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,681
that she doesn't need
any of this cosmetic surgery

512
00:25:45,683 --> 00:25:48,450
because you are a faithful,
loving husband.

513
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:58,293
How's the pain?

514
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,498
You know, I think the adrenaline

515
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,767
of actually doing this is helping.

516
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,036
It's the oxycodone.

517
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,706
That's good.

518
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:12,908
I'm glad you came back.

519
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,777
I never left.

520
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:26,154
I don't want to do this without you.

521
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:28,924
I don't want to do anything without you.

522
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:32,160
If you can walk,

523
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:34,162
you'll be different.

524
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:38,767
You won't need me anymore.

525
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,469
You think I married you

526
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:42,437
'cause I was having trouble
hanging clothes in my closet?

527
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,274
You're my girl.

528
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:48,443
I will always need you.

529
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:50,241
Even if I could fly,

530
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:54,030
who's gonna remind me to
call my mom on her birthdays...

531
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:57,083
or to floss? God, I hate flossing.

532
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,322
Who's gonna remind me
to be a better person?

533
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,794
Who's gonna hold my hand
when I'm scared?

534
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,605
That was nice.

535
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:35,557
You have to have the surgery.

536
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:47,102
You were distant before.

537
00:27:47,104 --> 00:27:51,072
Since the surgery,
you can't get enough of me.

538
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:52,774
It worked.

539
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:54,442
You're happy, I'm happy.

540
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:56,144
I love you. I always have loved you.

541
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:58,346
- I always will.
- You stopped loving me.

542
00:27:58,348 --> 00:27:59,881
No. Never.

543
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:00,982
If you were in love with me,

544
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:02,617
you never would've cheated on me.

545
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:10,892
Barry, please, no more lies.

546
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:14,898
You were never home. We never talked.

547
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:17,299
You were never there.

548
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:23,605
There was never another woman.

549
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:27,175
I was gambling... a lot.

550
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:29,611
I did it because I was ashamed
of the man that I'd become.

551
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:31,513
When we got married,
I promised you the world,

552
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:34,382
and instead I gave you a mediocre life.

553
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:39,521
When I was up,
it made me feel like a winner.

554
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:43,101
And I was too embarrassed
to let you see me like that,

555
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:44,703
so I hid it from you.

556
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:57,539
She's gonna do the surgery.

557
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,574
Thank you.

558
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:10,252
Andrews needs an O.R. for Emma Newton.

559
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:33,692
Claire, you're beautiful, smart,
and very good at your job.

560
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:36,830
Thank you, Shaun.

561
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:38,206
That's a very sweet thing to say.

562
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:42,537
Would you ever date someone
with a disability?

563
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,305
Yeah, sure.

564
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:51,812
You could choose the ideal mate, Claire.

565
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,034
Why would you want
the unnecessary burden?

566
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,003
Everyone is dealing with something.

567
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:03,908
We just have to love
other people for who they are

568
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,496
and hope they love us, too.

569
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,251
O.R. 1's prepped for Hunter.

570
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:18,104
I'll join you in a minute.

571
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,107
So, what changed her mind?

572
00:30:41,328 --> 00:30:42,627
Jared did.

573
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:48,066
Morgan, you're my first assist.

574
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:57,476
Make the call.

575
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,411
Thanks.

576
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:08,620
This is as far as you can go.

577
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:10,689
Nurse Matthews will take you
to the waiting room.

578
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,157
Okay.

579
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,793
Can I, uh... Can I give him a kiss?

580
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,128
Of course.

581
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,041
I can't do this.

582
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:32,244
Yes, you can.

583
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,313
This is what you do
in a relationship, right?

584
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:38,149
You take chances, together.

585
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:43,355
Okay.

586
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:03,742
That's a large tissue defect
in the left breast.

587
00:32:03,744 --> 00:32:05,610
If we'd been in here six hours ago,

588
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:07,779
I could have salvaged
more underlying muscle tissue.

589
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,414
I'm noticing her heart rate jump.

590
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,816
You seeing that, J.L.?

591
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:13,718
I am now.

592
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,120
How's her surgical sites?

593
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:16,555
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

594
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:17,689
Morgan, what about your side?

595
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:19,090
Everything looks good here.

596
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:20,392
Maybe the anesthesia's light?

597
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:23,228
Nope. No, something's
definitely happening.

598
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,497
Jared's right.

599
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:31,736
Suction, Claire.

600
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,939
Give me a 25 on a 130.

601
00:32:33,941 --> 00:32:37,676
All right, Murphy, I want you to
cut right under my forceps

602
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,744
very carefully.

603
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:44,349
Section's cut.

604
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:45,884
How are the motor evoked potentials?

605
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:46,985
Signal's coming through...

606
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:48,653
spinal cord's functioning normally.

607
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:55,994
The mass has fully encased
the medullary cord.

608
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:01,366
Give me the ferromagnetic wand.

609
00:33:05,438 --> 00:33:08,440
I can't get the caudal end
clear of the underlying cord.

610
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:09,908
Got a big drop in potentials.

611
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,077
We are compressing his brainstem.

612
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,812
- What's his pressure?
- Mean arterial pressure's 70.

613
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:15,046
I got nothing now.

614
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:17,082
Push IV fluids. Keep that MAP above 90.

615
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:19,017
Hunter's going into neurogenic shock.

616
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,452
We need to stop the surgery.

617
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:21,519
I'm almost there. 20 seconds.

618
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,521
Pressure's 60. Push vasopressors.

619
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,690
The last piece is right there.

620
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:28,093
It's probably edema.
Push 100 of dexamethasone.

621
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,229
Still nothing.

622
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,731
He's dying.

623
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,699
It's one damn centimeter of tissue...

624
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:38,670
All clear.

625
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,040
That's her second dose of amiodarone.

626
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,274
She's not responding.

627
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,010
She's thrown her septic embolism.

628
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:46,211
I'm cracking her chest.

629
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:53,585
10 joules. Clear.

630
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:56,655
Again.

631
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:58,590
Clear.

632
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,459
Starting cardiac massage.

633
00:34:19,812 --> 00:34:23,014
It's time to call it.

634
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:28,215
Time of death, 10:23.

635
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,551
Several specialists will work with you.

636
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,226
The first will be a neurophysiatrist...

637
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:47,228
Thank you. Thank you.

638
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,697
Thank you. I'm grateful to all of you.

639
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,301
Would you mind if we talked
about the rest of this later?

640
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,471
I just want to sit with my wife.

641
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:01,910
Thank you.

642
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,813
Hey. Hey. Hey.

643
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:43,952
I met a couple today
that lost their way.

644
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,760
They loved each other,

645
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:53,332
but by the time they remembered
what really mattered,

646
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:55,319
it was too late.

647
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:01,431
I don't want us to be like them.

648
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,572
I want to be fully committed to you.

649
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:10,096
I love you, too.

650
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:20,815
There's a surgery I could have
that should make me fertile,

651
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,375
but there's a risk of impotency.

652
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:28,514
What do you want to do?

653
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:29,982
I want to give you what you want,

654
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:31,884
what we want, a family.

655
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:35,325
We are a family.

656
00:36:35,723 --> 00:36:37,685
Yes, I want children,

657
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:40,132
and there are many ways to do that,

658
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:42,268
which we'll explore together.

659
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:46,632
But I draw the line at anything
that risks our sex life.

660
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,968
It's just one night a week,

661
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:01,313
but I think this could be
my big break, you know?

662
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,993
Well, you always had a beautiful voice.

663
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,685
Well, everyone's got one thing, right?

664
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:10,313
But enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

665
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:11,991
Do you have a man?

666
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:13,793
I did.

667
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:17,736
Pretty young thing
should have plenty of choices.

668
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:20,505
Hmm, I'm not looking to
complicate my life right now.

669
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,017
Hmm.

670
00:37:22,105 --> 00:37:25,473
Still looking after
everyone else but yourself,

671
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,837
like you did for me.

672
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,785
You know, I know brag to everyone.

673
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:37,187
"My baby... she's a surgeon."

674
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:38,522
Surgical resident.

675
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,658
Right, sorry.

676
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,527
You like it?

677
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:46,597
I love it.

678
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:51,101
Where are you staying?

679
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,736
You're... Are you in town for a while?

680
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,371
Yeah.

681
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,607
I'd like to be closer to you.

682
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:03,981
I found a place.

683
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,749
You'd like it,

684
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:09,053
but I just need to put up
first and last.

685
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,458
I'll pay you back.

686
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,664
How much do you need?

687
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,666
$2,500.

688
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,135
Plus I have to get furniture
and, you know, all of that.

689
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,071
I thought maybe you could
help me pick that stuff out.

690
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:28,605
You've always been so good at that.

691
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,141
I really appreciate it. I'm good for it.

692
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,574
Uh, Celeste isn't coming.

693
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:04,908
She broke up with me.

694
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,844
I hate her.

695
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,347
But I'm not gonna let that
ruin our night.

696
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,016
That's what friends are for.

697
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:14,785
They got each other's backs,
rain or shine.

698
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:17,855
By the by, I found a $20
in your battery drawer,

699
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,523
so I got us Chinese food.

700
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,693
- Don't thank me.
- I don't like Chinese food.

701
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:23,788
Aw, come on now.

702
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:26,764
Trust me, everybody likes
Ma Jong's Kung Pao.

703
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,966
There you go.

704
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:35,005
I'm pretty torn up
about that Celeste thing.

705
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,117
She was a real keeper.

706
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,154
You said you hated Celeste.

707
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,077
I do. I-I hate her 'cause...

708
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,479
I don't know... I kind of love her.

709
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,515
This tastes terrible.

710
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:47,217
Okay, then he hates Chinese food.

711
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,019
More for me.

712
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:51,088
Plain white rice?

713
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:55,692
Oh, uh, I got a gaming console,

714
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,628
and I hooked it up to
your bad boy over there.

715
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,929
We can play some "Mortal Kombat."

716
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,167
Come on.

717
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:10,407
We doing this or what?

718
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,142
It sounds fun.

719
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:18,482
Yeah, there you go.

720
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:21,952
This one's you.

721
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,521
That's you on the left right there.

722
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,423
- Okay.
- Yeah.

723
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,993
You got four arms,
but you're naked, so here we go.

724
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:32,529
I gave you a pneumothorax.

725
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,584
Ah, I didn't realize how bloody
this game was.

726
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,380
Ooh, a fireball. I got you there.

727
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:38,579
Have you played this before?

728
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:41,695
That looks like a spinal fracture.

729
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:43,918
Yeah, I'd say... I'd say there's
a huge fracture there.

730
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:45,375
You died.

731
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,617
