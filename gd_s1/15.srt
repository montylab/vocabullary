1
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,738
_

2
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,663
Please walk around the other way.

3
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,270
- What happened?
- Nothing.

4
00:00:47,272 --> 00:00:49,906
They're just getting the lobby
ready for the big party.

5
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:54,311
It's an annual fundraiser.

6
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:55,679
Like a carnival?

7
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,082
No, it's a swanky, black-tie ball.

8
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:01,718
You think a hospital lobby is swanky?

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,154
Not yet, but add some lights,
a few decorations,

10
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,588
and, most importantly, alcohol...

11
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,058
It becomes a streamer- and
balloon-infested hospital lobby

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,259
with a cash bar.

13
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:11,127
It's for charity.

14
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,363
Better to spend the money for the cause.

15
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,731
Actually, it's worse.

16
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,533
You need to spend money to make money.

17
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,134
I don't like parties.

18
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:19,269
Doesn't matter.

19
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,237
All residents will be expected to attend

20
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,006
and make a donation.

21
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:24,140
This is Dr. Alex Park.

22
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:25,462
He's the last of Coyle's residents

23
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,277
to be reassigned to our team.

24
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:31,414
Meet doctors Jared Kalu,
Claire Browne, and Shaun Murphy.

25
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,083
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,085
Welcome back. How was Costa Rica?

27
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:36,886
Beaches were awesome.
Monkeys were horrible.

28
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,928
Little bastards stole
my new camera and a pair of...

29
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:39,656
How old are you?

30
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:41,291
45.

31
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,960
That's even older than Dr. Melendez.

32
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:46,830
Dr. Murphy is a talented doctor
who has autism,

33
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:49,666
which sometimes causes him
to ask inappropriate questions.

34
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,002
No worries. Inappropriate
questions can be very revealing.

35
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,103
I'm a late bloomer.

36
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:56,139
Park's being modest,
which is very unlike him.

37
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,742
He was a cop for 15 years
before he went to med school.

38
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,778
Now that we all know each other,

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,629
Reznick and Browne have dibs
on cases this week.

40
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:05,749
You make your picks?

41
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,150
- Yes.
- Definitely.

42
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,904
Is there karaoke?

43
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:11,788
And now, our all-star lineup!

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,324
Playing center,
out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

45
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,059
Whoo!

46
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,127
Spirit, stop it.

47
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,529
They don't have time to fool around.

48
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:19,596
I'm not fooling around.

49
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,898
I need to document the momentous event.

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,233
Then at least get it right.

51
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,801
I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

52
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,569
Co-o-orrection!

53
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,204
From Taipei, Taiwan...

54
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,407
which is a believe
is a suburb of Moose Jaw...

55
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:31,975
Dr. Audrey Lim!

56
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:37,380
And assisting Dr. Lim are...

57
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,309
two docs I've never met.

58
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,151
Hello.

59
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:44,621
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy
from Casper, Wyoming.

60
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,356
And...?

61
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,526
Dr. Morgan Reznick,
Mill Valley, California.

62
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:50,560
Represent!

63
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,528
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

64
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,530
Okay, Spirit, that's enough.

65
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:56,399
All right, put your phone away,
or it becomes <i>my</i> phone.

66
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,935
Well, folks, looks like
the suits are shuttin' me down.

67
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,236
Thanks for all your support.

68
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,839
Love you! Bye!

69
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,475
Sorry, but my friends insist
I keep them up to date.

70
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,010
It's all right. It's a big day.

71
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,546
Spirit was born with
ectopia cordis. She's been...

72
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,482
Why didn't they repair it
when she was an infant?

73
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,517
- They couldn't.
- Her rib cage was too small.

74
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,454
But after 14 years
of slow and steady growth...

75
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:20,190
It's time to put this baby
where it belongs.

76

www.addic7ed.com

77
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,509
This is an interesting view.

78
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,611
I can see the aortic arch.

79
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,379
- Murphy.
- Oh, it's all right.

80
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:45,548
I'm used to people being curious.

81
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm sure you're looking forward

82
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,472
to when there's nothing
to be curious about.

83
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:52,388
Mm, what I'm really looking
forward to is... crowds.

84
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,191
You like crowds?

85
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,259
I don't know.

86
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,827
I've never been in one.

87
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,229
I can't go to a normal school,

88
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,798
and my parents barely ever
let me leave our house.

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,634
Well, when a small bump could
stop your heart, it makes sense.

90
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:07,070
But you still have a lot of friends?

91
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,338
Yeah, of course.

92
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,180
I mean, I just can't do
anything fun with them.

93
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:12,909
If you can't do anything fun,

94
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,031
then how did you get them
to be your friend?

95
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,414
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

96
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,549
I like to talk.

97
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,950
- Mm, yes.
- And, uh...

98
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:22,913
We all do everything online now anyway.

99
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,522
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get out of here

100
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,257
is take all my friends to a concert.

101
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,259
Like, general admission, on the floor.

102
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,581
I don't even care who the band is,

103
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,162
just as long as the place is packed.

104
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:33,930
Oh, and I'm gonna hug everyone.

105
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,398
You've never hugged anyone?

106
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,666
Not even your parents?

107
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:39,269
Kissed by my parents,
high-fived by my friends,

108
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,671
but, nope, no hugs.

109
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,206
It's just too risky.

110
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:47,416
Hugs make me feel trapped.

111
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,747
- Agh!
- Sorry.

112
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,115
Almost done.

113
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,217
Pain in the upper-right quadrant.

114
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,351
It's jaundice.

115
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,053
Bilirubin's off the chart.

116
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,335
That doesn't make sense.

117
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,190
He's been doing so well
since the transplant.

118
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,992
Yeah, every check-up this year's
been perfect.

119
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,760
Well, it could just be
a temporary flare-up.

120
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,361
We'll increase his anti-rejection meds

121
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:06,729
and do a full liver exam.

122
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,208
We'll know more then.

123
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:17,974
You two, do the work-up.

124
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,409
And you find a new liver.

125
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,971
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy result?

126
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,845
Not when I already know
what it's gonna say.

127
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,315
He needs a new liver ASAP.

128
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,116
I mean, that's gonna be hard.

129
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,084
He's Blood Type O.

130
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,352
It's gonna be impossible.

131
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:30,687
He's lucky they were able
to find the first one.

132
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,988
Well, he better get lucky again

133
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,090
because it's our only way
to keep him alive.

134
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:37,827
We're screwed.

135
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:40,897
Barbara Boxer got ear barotrauma
scuba-diving in Cozumel

136
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,232
and cannot fly for two weeks,

137
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,233
which means we don't have

138
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,468
a keynote speaker for our gala.

139
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,670
You think this is funny?

140
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:50,740
I've just never seen you anxious,

141
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:54,177
and I seriously doubt
Barbara Boxer scuba-dives.

142
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,245
It's just an excuse.

143
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:56,079
She sent me a picture

144
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:56,913
from the hospital.

145
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,181
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

146
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,582
Anyone can fake a photograph.

147
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,750
What are you doing?

148
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,185
I am doing a search

149
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,254
to see if our esteemed senator

150
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,622
from the great state of California

151
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:07,390
ever once... once...

152
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:09,659
talked about scuba-diving
in an interview.

153
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,901
It doesn't matter if it's true.

154
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:13,463
What matters is that
we find a replacement.

155
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,397
I need you to get me

156
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,331
a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

157
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,566
- Oh, Aiden Coulter?
- Yes.

158
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:17,700
Oh.

159
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,435
What? I sat next to him once

160
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:20,503
at an A's game.

161
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,065
And the story I remember is that you two

162
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,073
were talking smack that entire game,

163
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,875
and after he spilled his beer on you

164
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,977
and insisted on buying you a new jacket,

165
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,312
you refused him.

166
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:30,880
So he owes you.

167
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:31,981
Just get me a meeting.

168
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:33,752
I'll handle everything from there.

169
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,252
Okay.

170
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:37,320
I'll see what I can do.

171
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,555
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

172
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,959
_

173
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,159
Huh.

174
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,001
You'll be fine.

175
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:53,536
You've had liver biopsies before.

176
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,732
And they've always hurt a lot.

177
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,174
Please, isn't there another way?

178
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:00,416
Well, the other way, Eric,
would going through your neck,

179
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:02,117
and I don't think
you'd like that any more.

180
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,047
Eric, do you know why NBA players

181
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,748
all wear headphones before games?

182
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,283
Don't look at him. Look at me.

183
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,118
I need you to answer me.

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,354
Why do NBA players wear
headphones before games?

185
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,124
I don't know.

186
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,891
I guess they like music.

187
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,392
No, they <i>need</i> music.

188
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,761
Music helps them forget
about everything else

189
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,263
and focus on what's important...

190
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,675
the game.

191
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,067
Who's your favorite player?

192
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,368
Curry.

193
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,434
Okay.

194
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,975
This is the song he listens to
before every game.

195
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,908
How do you know?

196
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,645
Because he's my favorite player, too.

197
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,514
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on this.

198
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,549
Just this.

199
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,086
It's cold.

200
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,121
Yeah, now it is, but if you stay focused,

201
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,756
pretty soon, it'll stop feeling cold

202
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,990
and start to feel warm.

203
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,912
When that happens,
I want you to nod your head,

204
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,039
and you'll feel some pressure
and a small pinch.

205
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,464
What if it does...

206
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,087
Then close your eyes and focus.

207
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,555
You ready?

208
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,773
Two minutes and he'll be good to go.

209
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,359
How'd you know he was a basketball fan?

210
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,626
His shoes.

211
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,027
He's not wearing any shoes.

212
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:26,596
Yeah, they're in a backpack in his room.

213
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,451
You searched his backpack?

214
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:33,336
Well, it's, um, less invasive
than a rectal,

215
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,071
and most of the time more useful.

216
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,343
Okay, Spirit, just keep still and...

217
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,478
<i>And during a few parts of the exam,</i>

218
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,846
<i>we may ask you to hold your breath,</i>

219
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:45,615
<i>but it'll only be a few seconds.</i>

220
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,483
You got it.

221
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,432
You gonna buy a tux or rent one?

222
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,758
The fundraiser is black tie.

223
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,260
I have a suit.

224
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,394
It's new.

225
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:01,164
I bought it for my resident interviews.

226
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,932
It doesn't matter how new it is.

227
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,360
It's not a tux.

228
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,604
Wearing a uniform at work
reassures patients.

229
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,339
Wearing a uniform at a party

230
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,975
does nothing but make you
hot and uncomfortable.

231
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,977
This party <i>is</i> work.

232
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,179
Get a tux.

233
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,281
And not a crappy one
from some outlet store.

234
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,883
Get fitted by a pro and
spend a minimum of two grand.

235
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:23,045
You're gonna meet rich people
who can help your career,

236
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:25,087
and they're not gonna want
to help some slob in a...

237
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,055
I'm not a slob.

238
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,990
No, I am very clean

239
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:30,059
and make sure my clothes
are never wrinkled.

240
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:32,430
And it's too big.

241
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:34,697
Her heart.

242
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,562
It's enlarged 53% since her last exam.

243
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,238
Her last exam was only six months ago.

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,775
It won't fit.

245
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,042
Too big.

246
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,444
The biopsy confirmed
acute cellular rejection.

247
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,406
We maximized his
immunosuppressives, but, uh...

248
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,982
I found one... a Type-O liver.

249
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:54,350
Are you sure?

250
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,685
Park and I checked the registry,

251
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:56,552
and there weren't any.

252
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,887
I found it online.

253
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,929
He, uh... He already tried
to make a direct donation

254
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:00,990
a few months ago,

255
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,592
but the patient died before the surgery.

256
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:05,695
I contacted him, which wasn't easy,

257
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,797
but he still wants to be a donor.

258
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,265
That's amazing.

259
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,967
Great job.

260
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,335
What's the catch?

261
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,417
He wants to be a donor,
but he's not on the registry?

262
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,706
I mean, there's got to be a catch.

263
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,609
He, uh... He can't be on the registry

264
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,688
because he is in prison.

265
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,146
For murder.

266
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:27,383
Actually, um, seven murders.

267
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,817
Boris Tirayan was

268
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,731
a Russian Mafia enforcer
convicted of seven murders.

269
00:10:35,756 --> 00:10:37,471
Who now wants to make amends.

270
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,096
He tried to be a donor a few months ago,

271
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,066
but the patient died before the red
tape could be worked out.

272
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,467
But now that it has...

273
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:46,604
Are there any laws against
an inmate becoming a donor?

274
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,139
No, but there is a ton of liability.

275
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:50,381
What if he attacks someone here?

276
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,903
He'll be guarded by state prison guards

277
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:52,943
on a separate level,

278
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,865
away from patients
and all nonessential staff.

279
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,067
Everyone deserves the chance
to turn their life around.

280
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,649
The guy wants to do something decent,

281
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,884
we should let him.

282
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,119
I don't think we owe a murderer anything.

283
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:05,289
But maybe he owes us something.
He has a debt to society.

284
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,759
Which he would repay by
donating his inner organs.

285
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,027
Isn't it a slippery slope

286
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,695
between a guy who wants to make amends

287
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:12,897
and turning our prison system

288
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,965
into a superstore for body parts?

289
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,335
A slippery slope that
saves a child's life.

290
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:19,370
It'll never happen.

291
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:20,732
He's just trying to get a hospital,

292
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:22,100
where it'll be easier to escape.

293
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:24,241
You have no idea what his motivation is.

294
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,110
I know he's a lying sociopath

295
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:27,832
who doesn't care
about anyone but himself.

296
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:29,747
He's been a model inmate for nine years,

297
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,482
tutors other prisoners in the library...

298
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,604
Yeah, because he's trying
to get someone to trust him,

299
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,728
to give him an inch,
and as soon as they do...

300
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:37,655
We got approval.

301
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,157
He's gonna stall, make excuses,
and when he sees his chance,

302
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,525
someone's gonna get hurt.

303
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,694
I think it's worth taking that chance.

304
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:47,084
Anybody who doesn't agree,
feel free to sit this one out.

305
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,383
When you started menstruating,

306
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,372
the increased estrogen
caused pulmonary hypertension,

307
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:57,374
which isn't a surgical issue in itself,

308
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,677
but along with your
atypical vascular system...

309
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,313
Your heart's grown too big.

310
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,448
We will control your blood pressure

311
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,117
so that you will keep growing
but your heart won't,

312
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,039
and then, by the time
you're 18, we'll able to...

313
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:09,954
No.

314
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:11,755
I'm not waiting any longer.

315
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:13,223
Spirit, honey, it will be okay.

316
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,558
No, it won't!

317
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,062
I'm sick of being stuck inside
all the time.

318
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,998
I'm sick of this!

319
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,902
I don't ever want to text, call,
or video chat again.

320
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,637
Mom, I want to be touched.

321
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:30,858
I want to be shoved.

322
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:32,643
I want to be punched.

323
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,545
I don't even care, just...

324
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,072
Please.

325
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:39,534
Please.

326
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,553
I want this surgery now.

327
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,427
I need it.

328
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry. We can't.

329
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,708
We need to get rid of
all the furniture and artwork.

330
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,077
I get removing the paintings,
but the furniture?

331
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,747
Don't want the prison guards
sitting down on the job.

332
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,615
He's gonna be in full restraints,

333
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:12,983
cuffed to the bed.

334
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,184
Well, that's our plan,

335
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:17,321
but we also need to be
prepared for <i>his</i> plan.

336
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:19,823
Okay, we need to get rid of
the window blinds, curtain rods,

337
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,892
jacket hooks, and make sure
there's no metal rivets

338
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,394
or eyelets on the mattress.

339
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,796
Um, what's he gonna do
with a metal eyelet?

340
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:27,398
Tear it off the mattress and file it down

341
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,567
to cut your jugular,
or bend it into a handcuff key,

342
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,468
or shove it into an electric socket

343
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,713
to create a spark and start a fire.

344
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:37,674
I've seen knives made out of
toilet paper, soap, and salt

345
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:39,810
that could amputate a fat guy's femur.

346
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,955
Not quite sure he needed the part
about the guy being fat.

347
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,095
So... I've been thinking.

348
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,763
You want to go to
the fundraiser together?

349
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:02,299
It's not a prom.
We don't have to bring a date.

350
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,401
Yeah, we don't have to.

351
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:08,072
But we can, if we want.

352
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,994
Everyone basically knows
we're seeing each other,

353
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,608
but still...

354
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,544
I think it might be a nice opportunity

355
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:17,715
to take our relationship
out into the open.

356
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:20,717
Unless you don't want to.

357
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,387
No, it's a good idea.

358
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,521
Are you sure?

359
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:25,923
Because, you know, we don't have to.

360
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,643
Yeah. Let's do it.

361
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,799
Let's go.

362
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:38,435
What's wrong?

363
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:39,957
It's fine. He'll be all right.

364
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:41,839
No, I won't. I don't
want a murderer's liver!

365
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:42,940
It's evil!

366
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,975
Eric, there's no such thing

367
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:46,243
as a good or bad liver.

368
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:48,245
It's just a... just an organ.

369
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,180
Eric, this is your only choice.

370
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,450
If we don't do the transplant,
you will die.

371
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:55,092
I don't want him to be a part of me,

372
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:56,887
inside me forever, all right?

373
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,922
I don't care what you
or anybody else says, okay?

374
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:01,125
It's my body, and I don't want it!

375
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,849
That's ridiculous.

376
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,261
Personality traits aren't
transferred in an organ transplant.

377
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:09,387
It's also irrelevant.

378
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,922
Children don't consent to surgeries...

379
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,323
their parents do.

380
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,425
But if he doesn't cooperate
with the anti-rejection regimen,

381
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,661
we could be wasting a liver that
could save someone else's life.

382
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,223
No one's getting saved by Tirayan.

383
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:20,025
I found a Type-A donor.
It's not a perfect match, but...

384
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,933
His body's already
rejected a perfect match.

385
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,302
There's no way it can tolerate
an incompatible blood type.

386
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:26,003
No, the only way to save Eric

387
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,039
is to do the transplant
with Tirayan's liver.

388
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,040
That is it.

389
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,142
We have no other option.

390
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,581
Let the O.R. know we're gonna
need more restraints.

391
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,915
Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta

392
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,685
developed an experimental
resorbable material.

393
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:45,720
It would allow us to expand her rib cage

394
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,089
and create room to fit her heart inside.

395
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,557
An artificial sternum.

396
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,193
That would actually grow along
with the patient.

397
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,763
The surgery isn't reversible.

398
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:56,064
If it doesn't work,

399
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,767
we can't just move her heart
back to where it was.

400
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,535
It would allow her to have a life.

401
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:03,338
She has a life, and she'll be healthy

402
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,039
as long as she stays out of crowds,

403
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,174
doesn't hug anyone,

404
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,675
or do anything where she might fall.

405
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:10,645
I get you're autistic,
but I know even you realize

406
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:13,414
when a patient cries and throws
her phone against the wall,

407
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,283
they're not happy
with their current health.

408
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:17,018
There's no reason to make this personal.

409
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,953
There is if his medical
judgment is biased.

410
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:21,286
I saw she was upset.

411
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:25,493
You saw it, but you didn't <i>understand</i> it.

412
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:28,196
You're very competitive.

413
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,299
Are you trying to make
Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

414
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,569
or are you trying
to undermine my confidence?

415
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:36,905
I'm actually trying
to help you and the patient.

416
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,506
She wants to be able to rub elbows,

417
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:41,543
and you need to learn
how to trade elbows.

418
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:45,847
The resorbable plate
is experimental and risky.

419
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:51,252
But my medical judgment
is that it's worth it.

420
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,555
Make sure she agrees
and then get her prepped.

421
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,829
Why me?

422
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:03,731
I'm not famous, I don't know
anything about medicine,

423
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,900
and giving the keynote speech
at your fundraiser

424
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,603
is a steep price to pay
for a beer-stained jacket.

425
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,909
You grew up in San Jose.

426
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:16,411
You went to San Jose State

427
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:20,114
despite being accepted
by both Princeton and MIT,

428
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:22,016
and you headquartered your company here,

429
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:25,320
despite huge tax breaks offered
by Chicago and Minneapolis.

430
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:26,688
And it was his favorite jacket.

431
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,250
Well, when I offered to have it cleaned,

432
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,652
he said not to bother because
he didn't even like the jacket.

433
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,527
- He was being polite.
- Polite?

434
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,369
I take it you've never been
to a game with him.

435
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:38,867
You did some homework, but not enough.

436
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,935
I love this city,
but I have giving speeches.

437
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,271
So don't give a speech.

438
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,106
Tell us a story.

439
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,808
Like the one you told at the wrap party

440
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,530
at the Youth Dance company's
fall musical...

441
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:50,687
the one where you got lost
at the Paris catacombs.

442
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:54,249
I stand corrected.

443
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,751
Your success is inspiring, Aiden,

444
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:59,311
as well as your loyalty to this city.

445
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,790
And the fact that you're young,
apparently very funny...

446
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,108
I'm in.

447
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,308
Actually, I was in
as soon as Aaron told me

448
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,987
what you wanted to meet about.

449
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:11,466
But I was curious what
your attack strategy would be.

450
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:12,600
So, how was it?

451
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:14,410
It was very effective.

452
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:47,502
Now, don't worry.

453
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,103
He's been a model inmate for nine years

454
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:52,140
and tutors the other prisoners
in the library.

455
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:06,024
Coke nail come in handy
up at Pelican Bay?

456
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:07,404
I make jewelry.

457
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:09,439
Helps me pick up the beads.

458
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,843
Is there a history of cancer
or liver disease in your family?

459
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,525
I went through this
a couple of months ago.

460
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,146
You have my file.

461
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,647
We need to do our own exam.

462
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,082
And there's nothing about your family

463
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,083
in previous records.

464
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:21,384
Are they still alive?

465
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,619
They're dead to me.

466
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,688
Quit stalling, or we'll
send you back right now.

467
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,361
I haven't spoken to anyone in my
family since I was 15 years old.

468
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:34,131
Last I know, uh, both my parents
were healthy enough

469
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:37,326
to kick the crap out of me
on a daily basis.

470
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,070
Any other questions?

471
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,538
Why do you want to do this?

472
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,708
Maybe I just like, uh,
cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

473
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,676
- Why do you care?
<i>- We</i> don't.

474
00:19:46,678 --> 00:19:48,420
As long as you do what you're told.

475
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:51,214
Don't worry.

476
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,850
I'm very good at following orders.

477
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:05,195
Councilman Burns must be
very happy with his facelift.

478
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:07,130
He just bought another table
for the fundraiser.

479
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:10,066
I aim to please,
but you already knew that.

480
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:12,302
And I need to get into surgery,
so stop being so coy.

481
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,470
What's up?

482
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,874
You and Isabel always seem very happy,

483
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,610
able to manage both your
professional and personal lives.

484
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,789
I'm flattered you think so,
but still a bit coy.

485
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:26,817
When I met with Aiden Coulter
about being our keynote,

486
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,185
I thought there was a spark.

487
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,487
Okay, so now we're getting somewhere.

488
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,590
Surgery can wait a few minutes.

489
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:37,427
Is it... unprofessional of me
to explore it?

490
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:38,728
He's not a hospital employee,

491
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,565
but potentially
a significant donor and...

492
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,017
younger.

493
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,601
Quite a bit.

494
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:45,969
Mm-hmm.

495
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,652
I don't know, maybe I'm
just imagining something

496
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:50,907
that doesn't even exist.

497
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:52,075
Oh, I doubt that.

498
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:54,044
You're an attractive, smart,
interesting woman.

499
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,988
I'm sure there was a spark.

500
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,249
But you can't date a donor like Coulter.

501
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,576
Sorry.

502
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,853
There's no actual policy against it.

503
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,422
I'm not talking policy,
I'm talking optics.

504
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:07,357
The last thing you want
is someone thinking

505
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,544
you'd use sex to get a big donation.

506
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,797
It's a double standard, I know,

507
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,432
but it's the world we live in.

508
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,344
I said no! I don't want it!

509
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,471
I thought you gave him
something to calm him.

510
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:22,939
We did, but he's too agitated.

511
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,808
I'm gonna start him on IV midazolam now.

512
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,445
Eric... Eric, remember what Dr.
Park said earlier about focusing?

513
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,080
I know you can do that.

514
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,922
How about we get those earbuds
you had earlier?

515
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:32,757
No! Leave me alone!

516
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,984
Eric! Stop it.

517
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:35,785
Look at me!

518
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,654
Do not move.

519
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:56,940
You wear very stylish clothes.

520
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,341
Um, thank you.

521
00:21:58,343 --> 00:22:00,477
I assume you mean
when I'm not in surgery.

522
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:04,047
Yes. Do you think people
believe you're a better doctor

523
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:05,683
because of that?

524
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:08,184
Some people.

525
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,955
Others probably just think
I'm a show-off or arrogant, gay.

526
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,491
I don't care. I do it for myself.

527
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,692
You look good, you feel good.

528
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:18,295
Does it help you make friends?

529
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:22,666
Feeling good about yourself
helps with everything.

530
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:27,203
Do you know where I can buy
a stylish tuxedo?

531
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:30,006
I can pay $2,000.

532
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,241
Okay.

533
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:33,076
Dr. Reznick says

534
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:35,445
if I want people who matter
to help my career,

535
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:39,883
I need to wear a tuxedo that
costs $2,000 to the fundraiser.

536
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:41,718
Have you talked to Glassman about this?

537
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,487
No. I make my own decisions now.

538
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,926
Murphy, people who matter
will help your career

539
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:51,695
because they're impressed
with your talent

540
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,463
and potential as a surgeon.

541
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,365
And I could send you to my tailor,

542
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,901
where you'll definitely spend two grand.

543
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,936
But my advice would be just rent one.

544
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,498
Make sure you get fitted by the manager,

545
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:04,223
and for a couple-hundred bucks,
you'll be fine.

546
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:14,668
I'm gonna need you to count
backwards from 10.

547
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:21,591
10, 9, 8...

548
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,638
Looks like you were wrong.

549
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,433
I said he'll do anything
to convince us to trust him,

550
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:32,135
to let our guard down.

551
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,507
His eyes, they're swelling up.

552
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,946
So is his tongue. He's having
an allergic reaction.

553
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:44,214
Stop the anaesthesia.

554
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,649
Give me 0.5 MGs epinephrine I.M. now.

555
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:47,717
I'm on it.

556
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,954
- Epi's in.
- He's hypoxic.

557
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:53,590
We need to intubate. Getting a 5.0 tube.

558
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,191
Now!

559
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:11,572
You had a severe allergic
reaction to the anaesthesia.

560
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:14,575
We had to intubate you
and give you steroids.

561
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:21,081
You didn't do it?

562
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,282
We can't operate on you

563
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:24,446
if you can't breathe under anaesthesia.

564
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:27,454
You did everything you could.

565
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,016
The patient's parents wanted you to know

566
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,024
they're extremely grateful
for everything you did.

567
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:33,914
Or tried to do.

568
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,863
You can try again.

569
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:38,665
I'm sorry, we can't.

570
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,798
No, you try again.

571
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:46,240
Okay? Try again?

572
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,429
You try again.

573
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:51,545
Try again!

574
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:52,613
Try again!

575
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:53,480
Calm down!

576
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,549
Try again! Try again!

577
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,111
He said calm down! Now!

578
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:11,098
Same old, same old, yeah?

579
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:17,371
That's the way it's always been for me.

580
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,528
Nothing I ever...

581
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:35,188
He's still on the top of the UNOS list,

582
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,790
and we're gonna be calling and rechecking

583
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,792
every registry and database all night.

584
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,025
How long do we have?

585
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,433
Without a new liver, maybe a day.

586
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,207
So, what'd you get... Hugo Boss? Armani?

587
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:57,644
Dr. Andrews said I should just rent one.

588
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:58,879
And you're gonna listen to him?

589
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:02,916
He's the Chief of Surgery.
And he knows about clothes.

590
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:05,018
If Andrews had a son,
you think he'd let him

591
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,841
go to an important event
in a cheap rental tux?

592
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:10,957
He said people who matter

593
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,427
judge people based on their talent.

594
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:15,429
Yeah, that's what he tells
someone else's kid.

595
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:19,436
To his own, or someone he actually
respects, he tells the truth.

596
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:21,438
Cut here.

597
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:30,577
Do you respect me?

598
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:37,417
You're smart, able to memorize
a ton of information, but...

599
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,414
no, not really.

600
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,056
Suction the mediastinum.

601
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,197
You've certainly put a lot of thought

602
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,899
into what someone you claim not
to respect wears to a party.

603
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:55,381
Just because I don't respect him
doesn't mean I don't like him.

604
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,738
Everyone's uncomfortable in fancy clothes

605
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,840
and hates kissing up to bigwigs
at a fundraiser.

606
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:02,476
But they do it.
They don't cower at home alone.

607
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:04,778
You use your autism as a crutch.

608
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,484
Okay, I think if you liked him
any more, he'd have a black eye.

609
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,219
Make sure we're clear on that side

610
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:13,653
and the aorta isn't kinked.

611
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:20,026
The aorta isn't kinked.

612
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:20,961
Good.

613
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:22,043
Now for the moment of truth.

614
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,233
Position the plate.

615
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:34,541
Perfect fit.

616
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,384
What the hell?

617
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:45,981
What'd you do?

618
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:48,989
I don't feel nothing.

619
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,457
No, don't touch him.

620
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:51,792
If he can't control his bladder...

621
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:53,560
He can control himself just fine.

622
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,701
Nice try, but the vacation's over.

623
00:27:55,703 --> 00:27:56,848
Stand up.

624
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,032
Re-check his cuffs first.

625
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,134
You're getting changed, and we're going.

626
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,469
Just take him like he is.

627
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:03,804
I'm not gonna get stuck in the van

628
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:06,673
for the next three hours
with him like that.

629
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:08,642
Watch his hands! Watch his hands!

630
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:12,846
Put the gun down now!

631
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,314
You shoot me, he dies.

632
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,782
Now, no one is shooting anyone.

633
00:28:15,784 --> 00:28:17,584
Everyone stay calm.

634
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:18,852
Give him space.

635
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:20,687
You did something good, Boris.

636
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:22,088
Don't ruin it now.

637
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:25,062
I did nothing, yeah?

638
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:28,762
I accomplished nothing!

639
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:32,778
Whatever happens next
is completely in your control.

640
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:36,470
You have power, but it's not unlimited.

641
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:38,004
You're not gonna escape,

642
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,973
you're not just walking out of here.

643
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:42,876
But there are things, concessions,

644
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:44,444
that could make your life better.

645
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:48,648
So let's just take our time and talk.

646
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,383
There's no rush.

647
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:52,547
What do you want, Boris?

648
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:55,589
What do you really want?

649
00:28:57,758 --> 00:29:00,013
I don't want anyone to help me.

650
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,563
Whatever you call it,
these life-saving measures.

651
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:06,099
I... No.

652
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:08,068
No.

653
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:12,772
Do not do it.

654
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,810
Don't listen to her. It's your choice.

655
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:18,044
You do what you want.

656
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:20,046
Yeah.

657
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,115
Boris, no!

658
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:36,027
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

659
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,361
Melendez is en route.

660
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,502
All right, ready? Let's go.

661
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:46,393
3, 2, 1.

662
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,563
Page urology and cardio-thoracic stat.

663
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:51,396
He's dead and he has a donor card.

664
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,077
We're gonna take everything
he can donate.

665
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:21,072
Thank you so much.

666
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,491
Your speech was perfect.

667
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:23,575
And hilarious.

668
00:30:23,577 --> 00:30:25,276
Oh, you're very welcome.

669
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:27,846
And I appreciate the opportunity
to help change my rep.

670
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:29,447
You have a rep?

671
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:31,382
All work and no play.

672
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:33,398
Something I'm working on changing.

673
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:36,484
Your rep or your lifestyle?

674
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:39,216
I need less stress and more fun.

675
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:47,120
Would you like to play golf sometime?

676
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:50,994
On a real course with actual grass.

677
00:30:53,297 --> 00:30:54,669
Absolutely.

678
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,668
Would you like to dance?

679
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,703
I'd love to.

680
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:01,171
All right, let's go.

681
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:09,546
We need to get Eric prepped right away.

682
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:12,048
- What's happening?
- Did you find a new liver donor?

683
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,731
Actually, it's... it's the same one.

684
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,187
The circumstances have changed.

685
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,895
This is incredible.

686
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,491
No, I don't want it.

687
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:25,462
Eric, when the donor found out

688
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:28,832
that he couldn't do
the surgery to help you,

689
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:31,268
he became incredibly sad

690
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,711
because he wanted you to live
more than he wanted to live.

691
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:43,176
He ended his life so that
you could have his liver.

692
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:48,018
He... He knew he'd done some bad things,

693
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,055
and I think that this was
the only way he knew

694
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,812
how to make amends.

695
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,761
I think we should try and help him.

696
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,860
Do you think you can do that...

697
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,601
help someone do something good?

698
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:15,078
Yeah.

699
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,851
Everything looks good good.

700
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,085
Remember to take deep breaths

701
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,354
so you don't develop
any lung complications,

702
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,557
and, obviously, avoid
lifting anything too heavy

703
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,572
for the next few weeks.

704
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:31,933
I...

705
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:34,227
What, honey?

706
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,933
I want a hug.

707
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,000
Wow.

708
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:12,702
You look like a million bucks.

709
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,841
No, it cost $2,368.

710
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,242
Well, it was worth every penny.

711
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,911
Good investment.

712
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:22,445
Glad to see you're treating yourself.

713
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:23,713
You deserve it.

714
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,715
How much did you dress cost?

715
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,033
I don't remember.

716
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:33,156
And just so you know,
that's not the best question

717
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,257
for an event like this.

718
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,493
Why not?

719
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:41,044
I don't know. It just isn't.

720
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,400
Okay.

721
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:46,036
Can I buy you a drink?

722
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:47,737
I don't like tequila anymore.

723
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,406
It makes me vomit.

724
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:52,275
Well, okay. They have other choices.

725
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:54,744
A glass of wine or a soda?

726
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,184
No, thank you.

727
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:00,383
Uh, that's a partner at a firm

728
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:02,385
that did some pro bono work
for us last month,

729
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,654
so I have to go thank him.

730
00:34:04,656 --> 00:34:06,823
Okay. Bye.

731
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,565
Hello.

732
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:16,566
Hello.

733
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,880
There you are.

734
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:33,140
And nicely done.

735
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:34,284
You got the look.

736
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:35,819
Now you got to put it to use.

737
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,487
There's work to do.

738
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,768
Mingle.

739
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:40,924
Okay.

740
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,794
I see you, Dr. Chen.

741
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:47,764
She runs the Rivington
Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.

742
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,133
I wonder who brought her here.

743
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,402
I don't know.

744
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:55,285
Mingle.

745
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:58,705
You still think people can't change?

746
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,374
He didn't.

747
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:05,982
He's an assassin who
murdered people for money.

748
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:09,152
Today was just one more
cold-blooded killing.

749
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,287
You helped him sacrifice his life

750
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,678
so that he could save someone else.

751
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,556
I am not a fan of what you did,

752
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:19,129
even if it did prove...

753
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:20,730
He didn't sacrifice anything.

754
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,399
He died a long time ago.

755
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,601
His crew is probably gone.

756
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:27,137
In prison, he was a nobody.

757
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:32,488
And now? He lives on as a hero

758
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:35,298
to Eric's family, to the press, to you.

759
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,356
Jaundice is improving.

760
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,324
Edema's resolving, too.

761
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,839
His vitals look good.

762
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:52,729
It's been great night.

763
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,886
Three other lives were saved, as well.

764
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,133
Does his parents know what he did?

765
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,351
I want to send them a card.

766
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,812
I know they're gonna be sad, but...

767
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:10,647
I want to tell them I'll take
good care of their son's liver.

768
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:15,642
I think that's a great idea.

769
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:33,870
Wow.

770
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:35,672
This is impressive.

771
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:38,741
It's kind of like prom,
but without the acne.

772
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:44,047
And with a DJ that played
the MGM Grand last week.

773
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:45,215
Would you do me the honor?

774
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,253
Classy.

775
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:51,354
I brought my A-game.

776
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:25,388
- Take a picture.
- Ooh, you look great!

777
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,354
The first little while is the hardest,

778
00:37:58,356 --> 00:37:59,956
and then you move on.

779
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,891
You never did.

780
00:38:01,893 --> 00:38:03,459
Well, that's true.

781
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:04,994
Doesn't mean you don't have to.

782
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:08,965
Maybe.

783
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:09,966
Thank you.

784
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:10,934
Well, what are you gonna do?

785
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:12,869
Are you gonna sit around and mope?

786
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,567
At least try.

787
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:17,070
How do I do that?

788
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,669
I don't know.

789
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:21,032
If I knew, I would have done it.

790
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,679
Let's dance.

791
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:24,347
Okay. That would be lovely.

792
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,359
Don't be shy. You can't hurt me.

793
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:38,194
Look! I have a bionic sternum!

794
00:38:40,265 --> 00:38:42,365
Ooh, you smell good, Jenny.

795
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,833
What is that... strawberry?

796
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,802
Strawberry mango.
It comes with a lip gloss.

797
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:47,270
I got it at the mall.

798
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:48,471
We can go together!

799
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:49,872
It's a plan!

800
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,229
Let's all go!

801
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:52,976
You know what, let's take a selfie.

802
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:56,012
That's a great idea. Bring it in.

803
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:57,046
Bring it in, guys! Closer!

804
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,414
- Peace sign!
- Cheese!

805
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:00,943
- Yay!
- Okay.

806
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:02,552
That was so funny.

807
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:15,932
Okay.

808
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,537
Remember this?

809
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,039
Should I?

810
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,140
You really don't remember?

811
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,679
No.

812
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,981
What's wrong?

813
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:37,720
It's the song that played

814
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,402
during our first overnight
at the hospital.

815
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,493
We had our first kiss to this song.

816
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:48,564
I'm sorry.

817
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:52,039
It's been a long day.

818
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:54,170
Yeah.

819
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,170
Jared, it doesn't mean anything.

820
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,006
Yeah, it does.

821
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:06,345
I love you, Claire.

822
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:08,681
You never loved me.

823
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:13,603
Now, I thought that maybe someday
that would change, but...

824
00:40:14,526 --> 00:40:15,792
it won't.

825
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:23,333
Bye, Claire.

826
00:40:56,434 --> 00:41:00,203
I have 140 applications for fellows,

827
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:02,372
not one of them has a clue
how to write an...

828
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:03,439
Hello.

829
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:05,908
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

830
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,777
I'm a resident here.

831
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:12,815
I'm Dr. Jake Levy, surgical oncology.

832
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,884
Toby Yang, pathology.

833
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:16,652
May Curtis, ortho.

834
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,525
Okay.

835
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,260
Apparently I was wrong.

836
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:29,399
I told Dr. Murphy
he'd be fine renting a tuxedo.

837
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:31,033
Clearly, he chose not to listen.

838
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:32,368
I'm sorry.

839
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,603
Don't be. You look fantastic.

840
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:35,238
What is it... Armani?

841
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Yes, it cost...

842
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:41,357
Well, whatever you paid
for it, it was worth.

843
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:42,812
How's the golf game, Jake?

844
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:44,547
- Oh, same as always.
- Mm.

845
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,816
I know how that is.

846
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:48,684
You play golf, Murphy?

847
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:51,320
I have, but I don't like it.

848
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:56,159
None... None of us do.

849
00:41:56,161 --> 00:42:00,229
You know what they say...
"Golf is a good walk spoiled."

850
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,366
Yes.
