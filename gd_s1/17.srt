1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,899
_

2
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,163
The timing was good.

3
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,731
I just got a job transfer,

4
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,833
Gretchen will start at a new school...

5
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,735
We're gonna start a whole new life.

6
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,904
It's very exciting.

7
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,140
In college,
my dad majored in cheerleading.

8
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,144
That was a joke.

9
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,046
Gretchen's got a great sense of humor.

10
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,914
I'm laughing on the inside.

11
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,951
Soon you'll be laughing
on the outside, too.

12
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:53,986
Dr. Park.

13
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,387
Moebius Syndrome is a paralysis

14
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,823
of the 6th and 7th pair
of cranial nerves.

15
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,159
The 7th pair controls facial expression.

16
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,427
Luckily, in Gretchen's case,

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,762
we haven't found any limitation
to the 6th pair.

18
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,731
I'm a lucky girl.

19
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,434
We'll be taking two slivers
of muscle from your thighs,

20
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,102
along with their nerves
and blood supply,

21
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,437
and transplanting them into your cheeks.

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,038
There'll be considerable recovery time

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,107
before you'll be able
to smile at will...

24
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:16,442
maybe three months.

25
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,112
So, what do you say?
Are you up for this?

26
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,281
Can I sleep on it?

27
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,618
See what I have to live with?

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,486
Nobody knows when I'm joking.

29
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,887
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.

30
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,689
Yes, I am very up for this.

31
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,291
Okay, great.

32
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,959
So unless there are
any other questions...

33
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,395
Do you want to be a comedian?

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:42,134
People getting your jokes
must be very important to you

35
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,636
if you think it's worth the risk

36
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:46,305
of dying during elective surgery.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,783

38
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,759
I apologize for Dr. Murphy.

39
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:09,695
He's still learning
that silence is the right choice

40
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,930
when you have nothing useful to offer.

41
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,600
We are required to have an honest

42
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,069
risk/benefit discussion
with our patients.

43
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,938
We are giving
a lovely young girl a smile.

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,206
That's a simple equation.

45
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,409
Well, it's more than the smile
or the jokes.

46
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:26,612
She can't express any emotions at all.

47
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:29,281
No one can tell if she's happy

48
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,451
or sad or scared... anything.

49
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,321
She's never had much of a social life.

50
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,156
Ever since her mother died,

51
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,258
she's been completely withdrawn.

52
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:45,664
All I want to do is bring my
baby girl back into the world.

53
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,132
Don't worry, Mr. Milman,

54
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,967
we're gonna take great care
of her, all right?

55
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,409
Lucy has a post-op infection
of unknown origin.

56
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,778
Infusing 900 milligrams of clindamycin.

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,447
It's terrible, isn't it?

58
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,382
Yes, it is.

59
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,718
- Have you been changing your dressing?
- Every day.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,586
- Soaking it in clean, warm water?
- Yes.

61
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,723
Taking your antibiotics...
one pill, three times a day?

62
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,025
That's a no.

63
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,428
Lucy, I know I gave you a scrip
for antibiotics,

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,763
along with one for pain meds.

65
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,164
Why haven't you been taking
your antibiotics?

66
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,502
Did you have a bad reaction
to them, or...?

67
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,505
I never filled my prescription.

68
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:30,776
I didn't think it was necessary
until it got really bad,

69
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,945
and then I was too weak to go myself,

70
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,292
and I didn't have anyone
to pick it up for me.

71
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,883
Okay. Mystery solved.

72
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,119
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,854
I know it was stupid.

74
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,021
Very stupid.

75
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,103
Okay.

76
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,772
Hey, Shaun.

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,441
Oh. Hello.

78
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,410
I haven't seen you in ages.

79
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,444
What's... What's new?

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm buying an apple.

81
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,214
I can see that.

82
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,750
- Here, I-I-I'll get it for you.
- No, thank you.

83
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,419
Thank you, Shaun.

84
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,753
What else is new?

85
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,222
You didn't want to be friends.

86
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,425
Um, yeah, no, I...

87
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,989
We... We... We... We're colleagues.

88
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,906
You know, we're... Whatever we are,

89
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,798
we can still talk... We should talk.

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,866
I have a new friend. Kenny.

91
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,234
Here you go.

92
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,769
Thank you, Debbie.

93
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,105
Kenny, huh? That's, uh, that's great.

94
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,873
Do you have a new friend?

95
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,043
No.

96
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,878
- Okay.
- Thank you.

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,979
Thank you.

98
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,614
We can talk.

99
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,949
You know, we can talk about sports,

100
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,584
we can talk about weather,
we can talk about...

101
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,718
Debbie?

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,086
Why would you want to talk about Debbie?

103
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,621
Debbie was flirting with you.

104
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,824
She was?

105
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:52,925
Yes.

106
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,473
I noticed her exhibiting
two typical signs.

107
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,601
- Not the trifecta, huh?
- No, no the trifecta,

108
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,732
- and one atypical sign.
- I think she's just trying to be friendly.

109
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,702
She gave you an extra dollar in change.

110
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,405
And the fact that you didn't notice

111
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,407
means you like her, too.

112
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,978
Maybe she's just bad at math.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,488
My dad said
that you're on the spectrum...

114
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,757
That's why you said that
about people getting my jokes.

115
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,026
People always get my jokes.

116
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,628
Then you're very lucky.

117
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,165
That was a joke.

118
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,501
I see what you did there.

119
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,203
Yes.

120
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,308
They call me "Resting Gretch Face."

121
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,380
"Shaun the Moron."

122
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:53,781
Not very witty...
I'm obviously quite smart.

123
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,654
I drew this to their attention.

124
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:01,093
I'm on a spectrum, too.

125
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,131
Somewhere between inscrutable,

126
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,066
unapproachable, and...

127
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,068
actively scorned.

128
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,338
I don't want to be more approachable,

129
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,242
and I prefer people
not reading my emotions...

130
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,744
they're mine.

131
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,246
That's what you do with friends.

132
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,591
You really think
this surgery's too risky?

133
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,660
Possible complications include embolism,

134
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,428
hemorrhage, collateral paralysis,

135
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,498
asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke.

136
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,939
It's also expensive
and medically unnecessary.

137
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,608
Okay, look straight ahead.

138
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,546
There's a two-hour wait in
the E.R., and what are we doing?

139
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,781
Treating a woman

140
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,116
because she willfully ignored
doctors' orders.

141
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,119
I know what a "Parasite"
looks like, and it's not Lucy.

142
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,055
So this is a Mom thing with you.

143
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,556
Growing up with a whack mother means

144
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,059
that you can identify any
and all problem personalities.

145
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:10,062
And that is the sole upside
to my miserable childhood,

146
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:12,397
- thank you.
- Well, at least you had a mom.

147
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,565
Mine died when I was 6,

148
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,400
and Dad instantly married
a child-hating bitch

149
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,569
with a butt-load of debt.

150
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,538
Morgan, I'm sorry.

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,906
I didn't tell you to get sympathy...

152
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,375
just that I know "Parasites," too.

153
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,417
Got you booked
first thing tomorrow morning.

154
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,819
Dad.

155
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,587
What? Too soon?

156
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,922
It's...

157
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,391
You're nervous. I get it.

158
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,760
If you have any more questions,

159
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,961
feel free.

160
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,100
I've changed my mind.

161
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,069
I'm not having the surgery.

162
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,722
Murphy.

163
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:06,761
Hello.

164
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,162
Gretchen's father is very upset.

165
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:13,404
It seems you talked her
out of the surgery.

166
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,559
No, I didn't talk her out of it

167
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,827
or talk her anywhere.

168
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,459
I just gave her
the list of potential risks.

169
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:21,899
Embolism, hemorrhage,
collateral paralysis,

170
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:24,601
- asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke.
- Stroke?

171
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:27,629
Yes, there was a case in Brazil in 2004,

172
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:29,316
and the patient suffer...

173
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:33,076
It seems that you don't believe

174
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,637
that restoring this girl's smile
is that important.

175
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,518
Smiles are overvalued.

176
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:40,369
There are studies that support that.

177
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,708
And there are studies that don't.

178
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,611
When we smile, we produce endorphins.

179
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:45,946
They make us happy.

180
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:47,481
They make other people happy.

181
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,482
When we see smiles,

182
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,450
our basotemporal lobes are activated,

183
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,352
and we duplicate what we see.

184
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,788
Murphy, smiles are contagious.

185
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,089
You see?

186
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,893
I feel good, you feel good...

187
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:01,795
Everybody likes smiles.

188
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,666
I don't.

189
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:09,403
In any case, your smile wasn't sincere

190
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:12,239
since it didn't demonstrate
the Duchenne Marker...

191
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,242
There was no involvement
of the orbicularis oculi muscles

192
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,410
around the eyes,

193
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,878
which means you didn't
release endorphins.

194
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,248
You know, if you can talk her

195
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,083
out of a surgery she's wanted for years,

196
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,752
I'm pretty sure a conversation
with someone objective

197
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:27,254
can talk her back into it.

198
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:31,091
Get Park, come with, and keep quiet.

199
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,060
Okay.

200
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:38,432
Dr. Kalu.

201
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:40,834
Remember me?

202
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:43,070
"Fish girl"?

203
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:44,337
Uh, hi. Celez.

204
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:45,595
- Hi.
- Yeah.

205
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,774
Yes, uh, of course I do.

206
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,077
I hope it's okay that I requested you.

207
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,545
I'm glad you did.

208
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,113
How are you doing?

209
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,216
Oh, that's what you're going to tell me.

210
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:59,419
I've been wearing the, uh, tilapia skins

211
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,288
for five months.

212
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,857
I'm getting really tired
of being followed home

213
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:05,625
by stray cats.

214
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,127
How's the pain?

215
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,463
Compared to what it was?

216
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,965
Nothing.

217
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,801
Uh, any... any fever,
itchiness, or swelling?

218
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:15,969
Nope.

219
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,404
Well, it looks very good.

220
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:19,639
But?

221
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,476
How much longer?

222
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:27,147
Um, how do you feel about tomorrow?

223
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:29,416
Seriously?

224
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:31,585
I never joke about tilapia.

225
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,324
What's the matter?

226
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:39,993
I-I just wasn't expecting that.

227
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:44,664
I...

228
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,168
I'm afraid of how I'm going to look.

229
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,171
You're going to look beautiful.

230
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,943
Tomorrow.

231
00:10:58,313 --> 00:10:59,980
I know Dr. Murphy informed you

232
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:01,715
about the risks of this surgery,

233
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,783
and some risks are significant

234
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,385
and some just aren't.

235
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:08,455
This is as close to risk-free
surgery as we can get.

236
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:12,392
It'll give you a smile,
it'll let you laugh...

237
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:13,693
No.

238
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:18,298
Dr. Murphy didn't talk me out of it.

239
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,333
He inspired me.

240
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,304
He helped me realize

241
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:26,339
that this could actually
make me stronger.

242
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:30,210
I don't want to run from it anymore.

243
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,689
Yeah, she's lying.

244
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,492
She's a smart, sarcastic young woman,

245
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:48,662
not exactly someone who's prone
to inspirational stories.

246
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,161
Why would she lie
about changing her mind?

247
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:51,098
Well, when I was a cop,

248
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,404
I had a lot of people change their
minds about testifying in court,

249
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,404
and it always came down
to one of three reasons...

250
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:58,538
fear, confusion, or they were paid off.

251
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,273
She doesn't seem confused.

252
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:01,775
And I don't think she's afraid.

253
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,610
So Gretchen was paid off?

254
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:05,946
I admit the analogy isn't perfect.

255
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:09,115
It's close enough.

256
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,960
Guess who's back in the E.R.

257
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,628
You're happy,

258
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,297
so I'm guessing
it's a noncompliant patient.

259
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,799
You misjudged Lucy.

260
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,135
She made an honest mistake
forgetting her prescriptions.

261
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:30,971
You called her, didn't you?

262
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,806
She didn't spontaneously remember,

263
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:34,808
you had to remind her.

264
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,143
Is that a Mom thing, too?

265
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,646
Gretchen, are you worried

266
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,648
that your dad can't afford this surgery?

267
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,950
The insurance company is paying for it.

268
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,152
Dad...

269
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:48,421
I know it isn't.

270
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:49,923
It's elective.

271
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:53,059
It's medically unnecessary.

272
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:56,263
No one can put a value on your smile...

273
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,999
not bullies, not an insurance company,

274
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,234
not even Dr. Murphy.

275
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,936
In my opinion,

276
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,505
this surgery's medically necessary.

277
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:13,146
Gretchen, sweetie...

278
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,849
my first memory of your mother

279
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,653
was of her smiling at me
from across the room.

280
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,322
And because of that smile,

281
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,457
we ended up with you.

282
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,962
And... And my last memory memory of her

283
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,797
is that radiance

284
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,033
lighting up the world one last time.

285
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:38,805
I mean, we never had much money,

286
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:42,142
but as long as I had that smile,

287
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:44,277
it didn't matter.

288
00:13:48,884 --> 00:13:51,017
I love you, Dad.

289
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:53,853
And that's why

290
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:57,457
I can't let you
give up everything for this.

291
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:09,736
Lucy Callard?

292
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,304
I'm here.

293
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:17,010
Um, Lucille Elizabeth Callard?

294
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:19,112
Yes, that's me.

295
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:21,915
A Dr. Browne called me
to pick up my prescriptions?

296
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,775
You're the victim
of identity theft, Lucy.

297
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,184
There's an imposter
using your name and medical ID

298
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,348
to get benefits.

299
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:33,989
Did you have your purse stolen recently?

300
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:35,202
Six weeks ago.

301
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,141
And you had your driver's license

302
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,232
and credit cards replaced,

303
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:39,541
but not your health-insurance card?

304
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,769
Is this why the pharmacy refuses
to fill my prescriptions?

305
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:47,259
I'm on pain meds
for post-herpetic neuralgia.

306
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,245
It's getting really bad.

307
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,994
Once the imposter filled
her prescription for pain meds,

308
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,396
the pharmacy must have thought

309
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:55,898
- you were overfilling opiates.
- Oh!

310
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,000
It always flares up when I get upset.

311
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:02,038
Don't worry, Lucy,
we'll get you your meds.

312
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,079
We... We can't.

313
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:13,583
We're already treating "Lucy Callard."

314
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,155
Nice game, Tony.

315
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:20,423
Hi, Jim.

316
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,859
- Marcus, hey. You coming or going?
- Neither.

317
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,595
15-year-old girl
with Moebius Syndrome...

318
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,663
your company denied coverage.

319
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,601
No respiratory issues, deformities,

320
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:32,935
pain, she doesn't even drool.

321
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:34,437
She's fully functional.

322
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,873
She can't smile... That's a function.

323
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,941
Marcus, I think it's wonderful

324
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:41,711
you want to give
this little girl her smile,

325
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,779
but if we pay for everything
wonderful, we'll go bankrupt, huh?

326
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:45,114
And then who are we helping?

327
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:48,117
We all know doctors
cheat diagnoses to get coverage.

328
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,119
"Deviated septum"
gets you a free nose job,

329
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,454
"migraine" gets you Botox.

330
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:53,456
Do you really want me to play that game?

331
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,125
This isn't a game for me.

332
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,095
We're a reputable company
with very high standards.

333
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,730
Very high bonuses that get even higher

334
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,142
with your denial rate.

335
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,900
I was gonna suggest we end this

336
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,601
before we say something we'll regret,

337
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,203
but I believe that just happened.

338
00:16:07,738 --> 00:16:10,039
Gretchen's socially isolated, depressed,

339
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,974
and that's only gonna get worse.

340
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,843
What if she slashes her wrists?

341
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:15,178
You'd prefer to cover that?

342
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,246
Are you threatening me
with a teenage girl's suicide?

343
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:20,116
And God forbid
something does happen to her,

344
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,842
'cause I'll make sure
that this conversation's

345
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:22,991
part of the permanent record.

346
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,935
Dr. Andrews said smiles are contagious,

347
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:41,771
and I'm testing that hypothesis.

348
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:44,106
Well, I'm not sure your study
will prove anything.

349
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,608
It might have something to do

350
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,143
with the lack of the Duchenne Marker.

351
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:49,278
Oh, yes.

352
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,980
But here you go.

353
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:55,551
That wasn't a smile.

354
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,653
Sure it was.

355
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:02,391
I want to show you something.

356
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,371
You need to follow me.

357
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:18,574
Okay.

358
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:20,710
The impostor has poisoned
the real Lucy's medical record.

359
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,245
We have to go through every medication,

360
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,248
every notation, every test
to determine whose is whose.

361
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,083
Doing that with zero tolerance
for errors

362
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,484
could take six months.

363
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,419
Well, the paperwork
is <i>our</i> problem, not <i>hers.</i>

364
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,722
Not if the confusion results in
a harmful treatment

365
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:33,756
or incorrect diagnosis.

366
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,258
Well, we have to do something.

367
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,426
This woman is in serious pain.

368
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:40,930
So we treat her...
just be clever about it.

369
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,333
Shaun.

370
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,336
Shaun, I've already
had two iced coffees...

371
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:49,138
Debbie. Hello, Debbie.

372
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:51,440
- Shaun.
- You flirted with Dr. Glassman.

373
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,209
Oh, my God.

374
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:56,612
'Cause I have a new friend,
and he needs one, too.

375
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,914
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay. Look, Dr. Glassman,

376
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,018
Debbie's facial proportions
are close to optimal, okay...

377
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,220
.38 vertical and .48 horizontal...

378
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,956
- I'm so sorry.
- ...so you should find her attractive.

379
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,224
Thank you?

380
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,192
S-S-Shaun... I-I'm so sorry.

381
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:12,128
And I think you're both Jewish.

382
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:18,467
Tribal commonality is highly
conducive to social bonding.

383
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:27,576
Shalom?

384
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,279
Bullies can't put a value on your smile,

385
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,614
nor can Dr. Murphy,

386
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:34,250
but it seems the insurance company can.

387
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:37,453
They've agreed to pay $43,750,

388
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:40,456
about 85% of the entire cost.

389
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,492
I can cover the rest of that.

390
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:45,761
I swear.

391
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:50,466
Oh, sweetie, please,
let me do this for you.

392
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Okay.

393
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:00,676
Okay.

394
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:06,615
"Jane Doe"?

395
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,150
That's the only way
that we can treat you right now.

396
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:09,685
Go home and get some rest.

397
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,621
The records department will
call you to sort all this out.

398
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,659
A year ago, I was playing tennis.

399
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,561
And then the shingles hit,

400
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,563
and I was laid up for six weeks,

401
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:22,698
and I've been on pain meds ever since.

402
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,569
I lost my job, my husband
treats me like I'm an old lady,

403
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,404
and my daughter thinks I'm too medicated

404
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:29,839
to be around the new baby.

405
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:35,945
Maybe I'll be better off as "Jane Doe."

406
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,719
_

407
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:46,140
The imposter returns.

408
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,173
Lucy?

409
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:54,661
Lucy, can you squeeze my fingers?

410
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:57,965
"Lucy"?

411
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,831
She's in septic shock.

412
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,657
Order a lactate level, blood cultures,

413
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,192
and a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

414
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,494
I'll tell Melendez
we've initiated Sepsis Protocol.

415
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,762
We should report her.

416
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,230
She's a criminal and a flight risk.

417
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:10,464
And very, very sick.

418
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:11,833
We should put someone outside her door

419
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,467
and arrest her when she's stable.

420
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,703
We don't report
patients we find with drugs

421
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,471
or non-violent people with guns.

422
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:19,373
We do report people who steal from us.

423
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,310
What would happen
if people who needed our help

424
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:23,911
thought they would be arrested?

425
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,980
If they thought they would be
arrested for stealing an ID,

426
00:20:25,982 --> 00:20:27,215
maybe they wouldn't steal an ID.

427
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:28,983
I don't remember anything
in the Hippocratic Oath

428
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,918
about checking payor sources
before treatment.

429
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,286
Strongly suggesting

430
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:35,122
there was no health insurance
in 4th century B.C., Greece.

431
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,327
We have a duty to treat,

432
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:42,196
and we have the right to get paid.

433
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:44,498
But first things first.

434
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,668
Oh, God, I really do not want to be sued

435
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,837
by either one of these women.

436
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,308
Maintain the pretense.

437
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,011
And as soon as she's stabilized,

438
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,779
we're gonna press charges.

439
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:04,452
Dr. Park, pull the muscle, please.

440
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:07,255
We don't want any excess
gathering in the suture line.

441
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,958
Thank you.

442
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,227
Okay, remove retractors.

443
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,600
Ready?

444
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:28,976
Are you sure you don't want
something for the pain?

445
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:30,111
No. No, I'm good...

446
00:21:30,113 --> 00:21:31,812
as long as you keep talking to me.

447
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:36,150
Especially if you share
something, uh, very painful.

448
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:37,184
Painful?

449
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,586
Mm.

450
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,688
Okay...

451
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,659
like the time
I mistook my biology teacher

452
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:47,495
for my girlfriend and
picked her up in the hallway?

453
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:50,965
Yeah... twirled her around three times

454
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,700
before I realized my mistake.

455
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,901
That kind of painful?

456
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:57,605
You may have to dig
even deeper than that.

457
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,110
How about...

458
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:09,784
the time I finally found myself
in the perfect situation?

459
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:15,790
You know, work, friends, future...

460
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:19,060
something I never really had before.

461
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:22,129
Maybe that's why I screwed it up.

462
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,134
You're not responding to the antibiotics

463
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,170
like we'd hoped...

464
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,638
Lucy.

465
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,107
You know, don't you?

466
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:36,844
When the real Lucy Callard showed up,

467
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:39,213
it kind of gave you away.

468
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:41,983
Is there anyone we can contact?

469
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:46,320
Do you have any children?

470
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,589
A son.

471
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,825
But he'd be so ashamed of me.

472
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,093
Where is he?

473
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:53,227
College...

474
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:55,863
first one in our family.

475
00:22:55,865 --> 00:23:00,935
I had to choose between premiums
and tuition.

476
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:04,271
Your son is very lucky
to have such a loving mother.

477
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:09,243
I just wish you got your antibiotics

478
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,578
when you got your pain meds.

479
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,247
I didn't get either medication.

480
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,449
Are you sure?

481
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:19,186
Because the real Lucy was having
problems with the pharmacy.

482
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:22,089
I didn't want to risk
using the card again.

483
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:24,725
Is she okay?

484
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,767
Maybe it's time to move on...

485
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:36,971
take the lesson with you,
find new friends.

486
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:39,140
I went to Denver
for an interview last week.

487
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:42,476
And?

488
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:47,248
And... we're done.

489
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:50,317
Really?

490
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,154
Take a look.

491
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,556
Hey, trust me.

492
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:04,732
See? Beautiful.

493
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:14,108
The kid, college...

494
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,743
it's just a convenient sob story.

495
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,745
Why would she lie if she may be dying?

496
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:22,116
Here's what we don't know
about fake Lucy...

497
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:23,651
whether her story is true.

498
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:25,286
Here's what we <i>do</i> know...

499
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:27,621
She's a liar who just found out
she's busted.

500
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:29,623
Speaking of lies,

501
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,760
that shingles virus that
the real Lucy had last year?

502
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,596
According to Dr. Spindler
at Santa Clara General,

503
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:36,964
she had it the year before, too,

504
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:39,033
and according to Dr. Millhouse
at SF Muni,

505
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:40,034
the year before that.

506
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:44,972
She wasn't denied the pain meds
because of our imposter.

507
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:46,006
She was denied

508
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:48,142
because she is a garden-variety addict.

509
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,744
Well-played, sir.

510
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,123
Dr. Park says the surgery went well.

511
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,626
It's been too long.

512
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,361
What has?

513
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:10,064
She should be breathing
on her own by now.

514
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,199
Even after prolonged anesthesia,

515
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,635
it should only take 60 to 90 minutes.

516
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,041
Is she okay?

517
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:25,346
She should have
protective airway reflexes,

518
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,748
motor activity,
and a return of consciousness.

519
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:32,086
I need to page Dr. Andrews, STAT.

520
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:33,254
What's going on?

521
00:25:33,256 --> 00:25:35,256
Something bad.

522
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:42,199
Gretchen's glucose
is within normal limits

523
00:25:42,246 --> 00:25:44,394
and her electrolytes are also normal.

524
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:46,394
And we've ruled out hyper
and hypothermia.

525
00:25:46,427 --> 00:25:48,293
It doesn't leave much.
What about hypoxia?

526
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:49,885
Uh, she maintained normal oxygen,

527
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:52,154
as well as end tidal CO2
throughout the entire case,

528
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:54,234
and we've given reversal agents...

529
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:57,000
which we will repeat.

530
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:59,344
Do you feel bad?

531
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:03,157
It's okay.

532
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,431
You told them it was close to risk-free.

533
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:09,670
They knew there were risks,
and I told them, too.

534
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:11,801
Get a CT.

535
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,970
Rule out clots, hematoma,
bleeding, and stroke.

536
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:30,152
WBCs and lactate are rising,

537
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:31,653
O2 sat and MAP are falling.

538
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,188
The Sepsis Protocol isn't working.

539
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,690
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.

540
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:35,858
Medications?

541
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,161
Another antibiotic,
ah, continue crystalloids,

542
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,497
- increase her vasopressors?
- Low-dose steroids?

543
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,766
Give 'em all at try, and
intubate her and insert a swan.

544
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,136
And, yes, I understand
this is out of our own pocket.

545
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:06,355
Um, do anything exciting for Purim?

546
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,290
Purim. Uh, no.

547
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,958
Yeah... you know, the usual.

548
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,126
Mm.

549
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,528
Ate a little matzah,

550
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,299
and celebrated our
"Exodus from slavery"...

551
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,869
which I think is Passover and not Purim.

552
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,308
The truth of the matter is,
I'm only half Jewish,

553
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,811
so only half the knowledge.

554
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,548
The truth is I-I'm not Jewish at all.

555
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,817
- Ah.
- Yeah.

556
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,852
Yeah, my first husband was.

557
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:42,324
So I guess we have our
lack of Jewishness in common.

558
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:48,063
You know what, Debbie?
I think I-I should get going.

559
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,265
Okay. Well, it was...

560
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:53,602
it was nice, uh, finally
meeting you, officially.

561
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,736
Same.

562
00:27:57,074 --> 00:28:00,042
Oh, no, look at that!

563
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:04,580
A 1975 300D,

564
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,582
one of the most perfect Mercedes ever

565
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,283
just got a little less perfect.

566
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,318
I beg to differ.

567
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,953
If you're looking for perfection,

568
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,289
you look no further than the 1967 280SE.

569
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,557
Cabriolet or coupe?

570
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,759
The coupe... an all-time classic.

571
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,295
Well, an owner of a 300SL Gullwing

572
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,231
might argue otherwise.

573
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,799
A Gullwing?

574
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,134
Yeah.

575
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,804
Can I get you another coffee?

576
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,639
Yeah.

577
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,975
Iced, large, black.

578
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,110
- That's it.
- I know.

579
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,996
That's a little bit unsettling, Murphy.

580
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,933
Okay.

581
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,437
Why are you studying

582
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,440
the current of ions during electrolysis?

583
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:09,111
Uh, it's not the chemical
kind of transference.

584
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,613
It's the doctor-patient kind.

585
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,949
I'm dealing with a personal situation.

586
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,451
I don't think
the Internet is very helpful

587
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:18,687
for solving personal situations.

588
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:19,922
True.

589
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,958
But I can't exactly ask Claire
for her advice,

590
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,826
and I barely know Park, and Morgan...

591
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:27,062
Morgan would be bad.

592
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,531
Very bad.

593
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:34,937
I'm a person.

594
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:37,306
Yeah.

595
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,974
No, no... Yeah, of course, Shaun.

596
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,776
I'd, uh, I'd love your advice.

597
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,477
Okay.

598
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:46,481
Uh, so I think Celez, my burn patient,

599
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:49,484
has feelings for me, and I...

600
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:52,154
may have feelings for her, too.

601
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:56,325
But there's a good chance
her feelings aren't real,

602
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,492
and if they <i>are</i> real,

603
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,695
then they may not be permanent.

604
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:05,167
Uh, you know, it's kind of
textbook transference...

605
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,369
she's grateful and she's vulnerable.

606
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,175
And all I've ever known in my life

607
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:15,544
is unrequited love...

608
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:24,019
...from Claire and from my parents.

609
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:28,590
And that makes me vulnerable, too.

610
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,869
You should call in sick.

611
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:46,508
Lea says calling in sick is all you need

612
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,711
to gain superior wisdom and knowledge.

613
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:51,713
She was right.

614
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,692
The CT showed no abnormalities,

615
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:07,696
and the reversal agents have
been repeated without effect.

616
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,731
So what else could it be?

617
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,967
Anoxic brain injury,

618
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,303
a complication of anesthesia.

619
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,373
Unfortunately, we believe...

620
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:20,351
your daughter is brain dead.

621
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:25,559
What?

622
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,069
All for a smile...

623
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:41,074
I made her think she wasn't
good enough the way she was.

624
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:46,180
I should've listened to you.

625
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:47,691
Yes.

626
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:49,054
There's just no predicting

627
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,251
how individuals will react
to anesthesia.

628
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:52,686
Yeah.

629
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:01,662
Park!

630
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,330
You just walked out on that man.

631
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:04,998
The last thing
a grieving family member needs

632
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,306
is to see their doctor tap out.

633
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:11,542
Maybe she's still under anesthesia.

634
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,874
Succinylcholine...

635
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:16,109
It was one of the anesthetics
Gretchen was administered.

636
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,011
- Yeah.
- Now, what if she has

637
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:20,647
a Plasma Cholinesterase Deficiency?

638
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,883
It'd mean her body couldn't
break down that specific drug.

639
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:25,018
Complete deficiency is extremely rare.

640
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,486
I've never personally seen it,

641
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,021
and I don't know anyone who has.

642
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,790
Yeah, but if she does have it,

643
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,358
she's just gonna wake up.

644
00:32:35,297 --> 00:32:37,197
Should I tell the father?

645
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,232
No, not yet.

646
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:41,134
No way we're letting him grieve twice.

647
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,874
Your labs are not improving.

648
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:49,409
Your organs are shutting down.

649
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:51,411
You're running out of time.

650
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:56,884
I'd like to stop calling you "Lucy."

651
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:16,169
You're welcome...

652
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:17,537
Beatrice.

653
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:26,747
What are you doing?

654
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,517
Corneal reflex.

655
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,155
It's mediated by the nasociliary branch

656
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,690
of the ophthalmic branch.

657
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:46,099
What does it mean?

658
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,868
It means we were wrong.

659
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,570
She's gonna be just fine.

660
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:58,111
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

661
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,380
Thank y...

662
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,882
Oh.

663
00:34:01,884 --> 00:34:03,617
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

664
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,561
Honey, you're gonna be okay.

665
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,330
You're gonna be just fine.

666
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:19,032
I was drawing a bath, and I
leaned over to turn it off,

667
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,667
and I dropped the pill bottle,

668
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:22,436
and before I could fish it out...

669
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:25,138
All the pills were ruined.
So you need a refill.

670
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,008
My pain has made me so clumsy.

671
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,510
Lucy, you're a liar

672
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:34,514
and a cheat and an addict.

673
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,517
We know about
the frequent prescriptions,

674
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,053
the multiple doctors,
and the ever-recurring shingles.

675
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:47,728
You have a serious medical problem.

676
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,863
Let me help you.

677
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:58,105
Three months?

678
00:34:58,107 --> 00:34:59,506
Hopefully.

679
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:01,141
But we might be able to give you

680
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:03,610
a pretty good idea
of what you're gonna look like.

681
00:35:03,612 --> 00:35:06,780
Those things by your ears
are neuro-stimulators.

682
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,049
When we activate them, instant smile.

683
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:12,352
Sound good?

684
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:15,088
Dr. Murphy.

685
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,735
It's your mother's smile.

686
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,370
She seemed like a good template.

687
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:37,377
There is no Duchenne Marker.

688
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,713
Her smile is not real.

689
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:47,087
Thank you.

690
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:51,925
But all the other ones are.

691
00:35:55,431 --> 00:35:58,832
All the other ones are.

692
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,634
I spoke with Jim Ransler,

693
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:03,970
who made it very clear that
we owe him big time for this.

694
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:08,809
Don't worry, Marcus, I can handle him.

695
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:10,644
I'm very impressed.

696
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,480
It was all very presidential of you.

697
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:15,982
You really went above and beyond.

698
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,317
Yes, I did.

699
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,486
I thought I was saving her life...

700
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,655
instead, I nearly ended it.

701
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:25,859
Celez, hi.

702
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:28,829
This is the brilliant Dr. Murphy.

703
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:30,931
He'll be assuming your care
from here on,

704
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:34,067
though I don't expect you'll need much.

705
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,704
I understand.

706
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,773
I don't think you do.

707
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,007
You see,

708
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:42,976
doctors aren't allowed
to date their patients.

709
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,517
What are you doing tomorrow?

710
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,086
Uh, I'm calling in sick.

711
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,329
I think you may still have
some friends here.

712
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,577
I guess there is one upside to all this.

713
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,748
If she hadn't bought
the stolen insurance card,

714
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,617
the real Lucy wouldn't be
in rehab right now.

715
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,088
Surprisingly nice.

716
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,191
I told her what she needed
to hear to get help.

717
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:33,793
Trust me, I get it...

718
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,229
too soft, people take advantage of you.

719
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,331
But with your badass upbringing,

720
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,500
no one messes with you.

721
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,269
Upsides everywhere.

722
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,739
You have way more street cred than, say,

723
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:49,843
someone whose mom's
a Johns Hopkins cardiologist,

724
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:51,778
whose dad's a pathologist,

725
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,114
and whose parents have been
happily married for 37 years.

726
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,720
Coming from privilege... zero respect.

727
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:03,990
Must be really hard to overcome.

728
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:09,496
- I'll call a code.
- No.

729
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:12,832
There's nothing left to save.

730
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,648
Time of death, 8:14 P.M.

731
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:42,095
I'll notify her son.

732
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:33,980
Oh, hey.

733
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,650
Um, my homies decided to pop by

734
00:39:36,652 --> 00:39:38,818
and, uh, play some Texas Hold'em,

735
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,754
so I'm gonna have to take a
rain check on that pizza night.

736
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:44,658
You got a 70inch flat-screen, too.

737
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,661
Uh, no. I borrowed yours.

738
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:51,731
Makes no sense for us both
to have one, right?

739
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,134
Plus homies got to watch March Madness.

740
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:56,673
- Okay.
- Oh, um, sorry, <i>amigo.</i>

741
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,605
It's four-player Texas Hold'em.

742
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:03,143
- I don't like poker anyway.
- Hey, Shaun.

743
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:06,269
Look, you're a great guy,

744
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:09,761
um, but you got a few,

745
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:13,917
like, quirks, you know?

746
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:16,022
And that...

747
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,533
It doesn't really...

748
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:21,666
jive with this kind of face time.

749
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:24,130
You get what I'm saying, right?

750
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,471
I love you, man.

751
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:45,552
I once drove a 300SL...

752
00:40:45,554 --> 00:40:49,155
Thank you... a 300SL Gullwing.

753
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,724
On the road?

754
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:51,791
No.

755
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:53,693
For 200 feet at the Concours d'Elegance.

756
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:55,830
Oh, in Pebble Beach...
That's just as cool.

757
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,163
The car show... You know it?

758
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,976
Of course, yeah.

759
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:02,646
This year, they're featuring
a Rollston Coachwork display.

760
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,537
Including the Mercedes SS?

761
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,139
- I don't know.
- Ah!

762
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,108
But we should find out.

763
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,542
Do you want to go?

764
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,379
I couldn't.

765
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,076
Yeah, no, I...

766
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,772
Why?

767
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,518
No reason.

768
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,927
I just... I just... thought

769
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:23,390
that I should make that my first
response before I accepted.

770
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,646
Can I get you anything else?

771
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,633
No, thank you.
We'll just take the doorstop.

772
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,048
I'm sorry. Um, well...

773
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,688
Well, you can bring the doorstop.

774
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,780
Aaron?

775
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,716
Sorry. Um...

776
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,385
The thing...

777
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:57,157
The thing... The thing...
The thing that... that...

778
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:00,906
that t-tells you how much
to pay, the... the doorstop.

779
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:07,934
Could you call a...

780
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,169
Can you call an ambulance, please?

781
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,226
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

782
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:21,142
