1
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,968
Mister?

2
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,063
Mister?

3
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,161
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

4
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:29,572
<i>welcome to San Jose
International Airport.</i>

5
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:58,269
Look out! Watch out!

6
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,969
Help!

7
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:03,604
- Adam?!
- Oh, my God!

8
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:04,938
Adam?!

9
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,641
Somebody call 911!

10
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,322
Oh, my God!

11
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:14,115
I'm a doctor, let me take
a look. Let me take a look.

12
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:16,692
His jugular vein's been cut.

13
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,959
Does anyone have a clean cloth?
Please. Someone!

14
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,295
I have a fresh change
of clothes in my bag.

15
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:21,228
That's great.

16
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,161
You're killing him.

17
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,575
I'm saving his life.
He was bleeding out.

18
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:37,444
N... You have it in the wrong place.

19
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,515
I think I remember enough of Anatomy 101

20
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,850
to know where the jugular vein is.

21
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,186
You would be in the right place
if he were an adult.

22
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:44,982
He's not an adult. He is a boy.

23
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:47,457
Which means you're also putting
pressure on his trachea.

24
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:50,318
Which means he's not
currently breathing.

25
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:54,417
You have to put the pressure higher up.

26
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,668
There.

27
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,129
Some glass. He'll be fine.

28
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,890
Who are you?

29
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,518
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

30
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,753
I'm a surgical resident

31
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,970
at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

32

33
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,361
Autism...

34
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:35,344
a mental condition
characterized by difficulty

35
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,449
in communicating and using
language and abstract concepts.

36
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:40,824
That's the definition.

37
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:43,227
Does it sound like
I'm describing a surgeon?

38
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,329
He's not Rain Man.

39
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,516
He's high functioning, he's
capable of living on his own,

40
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,758
capable of managing his own affairs.

41
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,369
"High functioning"?

42
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:54,638
Is that our new hiring standard?

43
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,190
If it were, you wouldn't be here.

44
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:59,075
I'm sorry. Is this
really necessary? Really?

45
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,519
A special meeting
of the Board of Directors...

46
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,590
as much as I love you all...

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,310
questioning one of my hiring decisions?

48
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,357
Did you bother to look up
the definition of "President"

49
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,925
while you were skimming the dictionary?

50
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,827
You're hiring him to be
a surgical resident...

51
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,397
my department... over my objections.

52
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,947
Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

53
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,000
<i>I</i> made it personal?

54
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,544
You've wanted his job since day one.

55
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,802
Everyone in this room knows that.

56
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,205
And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital.

57
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,335
But the money it takes to run it

58
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,036
comes from the Foundation I control.

59
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,772
So let's all play nice, shall we?

60
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,874
Stop acting like you're stunned
that you're standing there.

61
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,208
You tried to slip one past us.

62
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,478
I vetted him like I would
any other candidate.

63
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,246
And you genuinely thought
that this Board

64
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,215
wouldn't reasonably
have any doubts about

65
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:44,453
hiring a surgeon who's been
diagnosed with autism?

66
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:46,421
So justify your decision.

67
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:52,059
I met Shaun Murphy
when he was 14 years old.

68
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,595
I was living in Wyoming at the time.

69
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:58,499
He was, and he still is,
an extraordinary young man.

70
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:02,669
Yes, he has autism, but he also
has savant syndrome...

71
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,139
genius-level skills in several areas.

72
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:08,908
He has almost perfect recall.
He has spatial intelligence.

73
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,812
And he sees things
and analyzes things in ways

74
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:14,814
that... that are just remarkable.

75
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:17,850
In ways that we can't
even begin to understand.

76
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:20,420
Those are assets. Undeniable assets

77
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,423
for any doctor, particularly a surgeon.

78
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:28,564
You've known him since he was 14?

79
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:31,130
You care about him.
He's like a son to you.

80
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:34,333
Dr. Andrews, your wife is gonna
be very upset with you.

81
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,101
If you're trying to turn this
into a nepotism case,

82
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,770
we're gonna have to fire her
idiot nephew from bookkeeping.

83
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:46,829
Hey!

84
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:48,256
Sorry. You seen Claire?

85
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:49,447
Would you turn off the light?

86
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,648
Sure. You seen Claire?

87
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,883
Why? Would you turn off the light?

88
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,652
Melendez wants to operate on 104,

89
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,620
but Claire hasn't gotten
informed consent.

90
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:59,122
And she's ignoring her page.
You seen her?

91
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:01,224
No. Now go away and turn off the light.

92
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,971
Sure.

93
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,053
They need you to, um...

94
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,006
I heard.

95
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,107
Oh, she's such a bitch.

96
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,983
No.

97
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,112
She just doesn't like you.

98
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:24,764
Hmm.

99
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,320
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

100
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,472
Um, maybe.

101
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:32,920
To say for sure, I'd need to know

102
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:34,589
what it is you're talking about.

103
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:35,832
Us.

104
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:39,238
- Ah. Not silly at all.
- Hmm.

105
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,995
Quite a bit of fun, actually.

106
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:44,365
I meant that we're hiding it.
Our relationship.

107
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,992
Hmm. Well...

108
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:51,705
Jared, we don't have a relationship.

109
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,353
We have sex.

110
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,511
But, if you want to tell people

111
00:07:57,513 --> 00:08:00,892
that you're screwing me, go for it.

112
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,033
_

113
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:26,963
_

114
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,474
The veins in the boy's
left arm are popping.

115
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,735
- Is that bad?
- I-I don't see.

116
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,157
Intrathoracic pressure.

117
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,247
No, his chest is rising. He's breathing.

118
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,650
No, the... the chest
is moving paradoxically.

119
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,417
The left lung is in distress.

120
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,729
_

121
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:46,799
__

122
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,077
Yes.

123
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,959
Who here has a sharp knife,
blade five inches or longer?

124
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,778
Nobody?

125
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,651
You should start artificial respiration.

126
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,986
He's going to stop breathing very soon.

127
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,879
- I feel fine.
- Dr. Melendez would like

128
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,995
to do the surgery today.

129
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,761
You need bypass surgery quite urgently.

130
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,253
Would you please sign the consent?

131
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,142
No.

132
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,425
You're scared.

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,863
- I-I'm not scared.
- Well, you should be.

134
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:24,403
We're gonna cut your chest open,

135
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:27,383
we're gonna stop your heart,
repair it and restart it.

136
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,941
Are you seriously telling me
that that doesn't scare you?

137
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,821
I just want a second opinion.

138
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:35,694
Callum, yesterday,
your life was perfect.

139
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,939
You were playing tennis,
you had a big anniversary.

140
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,186
Today, you're lying in a hospital bed

141
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:43,511
trying to figure out
the best way to say goodbye,

142
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,861
maybe forever, to your teenage children.

143
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,062
Why are you doing this?

144
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,228
Because I can't deal with lies.

145
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:54,480
If you lie to me,
my answers won't help you.

146
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:59,262
But, if you're scared, I can help you.

147
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,830
I'm scared.

148
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,564
Okay.

149
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:11,370
- You can't be back here.
- Oh, I need a knife.

150
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,605
Where do you keep the knives

151
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,111
people forget they're traveling with?

152
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,591
A knife? Sure. Anything else?

153
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:20,412
I do also need a narrow six-foot tube

154
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:21,913
and high-proof alcohol and gloves

155
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,048
and baggage-handling tape,
but I am going to get

156
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,450
the alcohol from the duty-free store

157
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:27,352
and the tube from
the back of a soda machine.

158
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,053
Well, I wish you all the luck with that.

159
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,054
But I'm not gonna give you a knife.

160
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,508
No, I need a knife.
It-It's... It's very...

161
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,476
There is a medical emergency.
There's a medical emergency.

162
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:39,230
That one. That one, right near
the top, looks very sharp.

163
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,364
Would you get it for me?

164
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,753
No, I'm not gonna give you a knife.

165
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,457
- I'll ask...
- There's not the time.

166
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,652
Weapon! Weapon!

167
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,249
Move! Get out of the way!

168
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,733
Drop it.

169
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:58,531
You idiot! You're lucky
we didn't just shoot.

170
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,017
No! He's trying to save my son's life.

171
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:11,377
You get that consent on 104?

172
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,140
Well, I made him a deal.

173
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,166
He's got a meeting with
Dr. Max from psychiatry at 6:00,

174
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,699
we'll get the consent by 8:00,

175
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,432
we can operate first thing
in the morning.

176
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,369
You did pass anatomy, right, Dr. Browne?

177
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,970
His problem's in his heart,
not his head.

178
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,806
He's not psychologically
ready for surgery.

179
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,007
He will be. Soon.

180
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,241
Well, he is physically ready.

181
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,344
So, get the consent.
We're prepping O.R. 6 now.

182
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:31,745
Do I need to cite you
the 17 studies that show

183
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,447
a correlation between
attitude and outcome

184
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,648
in surgical patients?

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,001
Do I need to remind you
that I am your superior?

186
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,399
You do know what the opposite
of superior is, right?

187
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:46,159
- Subordinate. Doesn't...
- Sure. Subordinate. Or... inferior.

188
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,661
- Either way.
- It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

189
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,697
I suppose not.

190
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:54,254
But it does mean you have
to act like you're wrong.

191
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,231
He's panic stricken.

192
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,439
Yesterday, he was young and healthy.

193
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,940
Today, he's mortal.

194
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,527
Just give him a chance
to wrap his head around that.

195
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,765
Dr. Kalu?

196
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,417
Do you think you can get me

197
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,577
a signed informed consent on 104?

198
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,091
- Of course.
- Thank you.

199
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,509
You think he's right?

200
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,185
I think he's my boss.

201
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:30,860
And if I have to choose
between my boss and...

202
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:33,418
the woman I'm screwing,

203
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,402
not much of a choice, am I right?

204
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,919
Excuse me. Excuse me, please?

205
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:32,028
_

206
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:35,084
The incision should
take place two ribs down.

207
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,322
Okay, well, why the bottle?

208
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,357
The air will continue
to leak and accumulate

209
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,493
until the damage
can be properly repaired.

210
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,741
The tube allows the air to get out.

211
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,166
The water in the bottle stops
the air from coming back in.

212
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,298
A homemade one-way valve.

213
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,169
He's breathing.

214
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,094
You saved his life.

215
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,193
He saved his life!

216
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,916
Shaun, where are you? I-I...

217
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,740
Call me as soon as you can, please.

218
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,298
- That was a mistake.
- I agree,

219
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,333
'cause it's not about the new
doctor, this is about you.

220
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:50,202
They're baiting you.
And you're letting them.

221
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,370
- Maybe.
- Maybe what?

222
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:52,871
What mistake are you talking about?

223
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:56,015
- Your shot at Andrews' nephew.
- Oh, come on. It was funny.

224
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,442
- It was very funny.
- It was also disrespectful.

225
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:59,717
Well, you don't show him respect.

226
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,445
I assume it's because
you don't respect him.

227
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,281
You show someone respect
because you respect them,

228
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,537
or because you're afraid of them.

229
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,050
I don't fit into either category.

230
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,385
Well, neither do I.

231
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,196
You should.

232
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,121
You're only in that room
because your grandfather

233
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,243
founded this hospital.

234
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,494
I'm gonna pretend that this conversation

235
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,663
didn't take this tangent,
and instead focus on something

236
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,045
relevant... the debate you are losing.

237
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,751
Here's how you win this.

238
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:26,670
You don't make it personal.
You do not make it about you.

239
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,918
That is what they want,
and if you give it to them,

240
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,215
you will lose.

241
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,574
I need to get to San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

242
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:38,922
That's where we're going.

243
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,549
Good.

244
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,456
<i>How hard can it be</i>

245
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,648
<i>to just act like a normal human being?!</i>

246
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:52,943
<i>- He doesn't know how.
- Bull!</i>

247
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,006
What are we supposed to do now? Huh?

248
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:57,164
<i>This is the third school
he's been thrown out of.</i>

249
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,299
<i>We'll find another school.</i>

250
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,067
<i>No, we won't, 'cause
nothing's gonna change.</i>

251
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,236
<i>They can't handle him,
and I don't blame them,</i>

252
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,970
<i>'cause obviously,
we can't handle him, either.</i>

253
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:05,405
<i>What the hell happened this time?</i>

254
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,073
<i>What happened?!</i>

255
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,174
<i>You're hurting him.</i>

256
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,186
<i>What did you do?!</i>

257
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,178
<i>- Shaun!
- No!</i>

258
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,316
<i>Will you stop petting
that stupid rabbit?!</i>

259
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,787
It changed.

260
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,646
The boy's ECG changed.

261
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,180
It's the same... 86 BPM.

262
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,469
No. It used to be higher.

263
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:42,075
No, it used to be 86. It's still 86.

264
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,933
It used to come up to here.

265
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,044
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

266
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:49,247
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

267
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,848
What's going on? What does it mean?

268
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,849
It means he's trying to read
20-year-old equipment

269
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,118
while traveling in a vehicle
going 40 miles an hour.

270
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,221
How did you get him to sign?

271
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,791
I simply told him it was either
consenting or going home,

272
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:04,789
then I gave him two forms
and told him to pick one.

273
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,331
And you highlighted the Release Against

274
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,832
Medical Advice form that mentions

275
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:11,458
the "possibility of death
or permanent disability"?

276
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,169
Well done.

277
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,876
Hand me the Metz and a pick-up.

278
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:16,380
I'm isolating the descending aorta.

279
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,970
Vascular clamp.

280
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,766
What is that?

281
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,465
Under the left atrium...

282
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,705
something white.

283
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:27,252
Is that part of the lung?

284
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:30,089
It's pus.

285
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:31,674
Did he have TB?

286
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,033
No, he doesn't have any...

287
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,189
No, not currently.
Does he have a history...

288
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,357
When he was younger,
he was exposed to...

289
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,525
This is an abscess. It's gonna bur...

290
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:40,505
Suction and a lap sponge.
His BP's crashing.

291
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,911
Two liters saline wide open.

292
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,636
Set up the level one.
Two units packed cells now.

293
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:47,365
Get Levophed on board
and keep that MAP at 60.

294
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,461
Get in there with the suction.
I can't see a damn thing.

295
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,373
Suction.

296
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,343
I hope it isn't too upsetting
to him when he hears

297
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,700
he would have died in his room

298
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:56,243
if we'd waited until tomorrow.

299
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:59,075
Dr. Melendez, we've got
an incoming 8-year-old male,

300
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,438
pneumothorax stabilized,

301
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,139
but undetermined internal injuries.

302
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,341
Who do you want to catch?

303
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,176
Claire, I don't think we need you.

304
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,286
This patient is gonna be fine... now.

305
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,550
8-year-old healthy boy,

306
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:14,385
status post encounter with
a shattered glass sign.

307
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,586
Numerous lacerations.

308
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,654
- Echo...
- Get him set up in Trauma 3

309
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,989
with an EKG, full
blood work and a pan-scan.

310
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:22,204
We need an echo... echocardiogram.

311
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:24,621
- Who is this guy?
- He helped with first-aid at the airport.

312
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,863
I'm the doctor.
He needs an echocardiogram.

313
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,429
- Where are you taking him?
- To surgery.

314
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,621
All cardiac vital signs
are within normal range.

315
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:33,816
- Do you have any I.D.?
- No. His... His heart. It's his heart.

316
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:35,850
His heart is fine. Now stay here.

317
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:37,519
Adam needs an echocardiogram.

318
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,534
No. Behave yourself. Or you'll
be removed from the building.

319
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,717
Echo. Echo.

320
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:03,094
What's that?

321
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,430
A one-way valve.

322
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:07,842
And he reports the boy
suffered a pneumothorax.

323
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,835
That is cool.

324
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,718
Do you think we should
do an echocardiogram?

325
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,767
Based on the presenting
symptoms, which give

326
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,393
no indication that
an echocardiogram is necessary,

327
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,843
I'm going to answer no.

328
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,540
Am I missing something?

329
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,412
No, sir.

330
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,910
Knife.

331
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:24,114
<i>We don't normally
treat rabbits, especially...</i>

332
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,590
<i>This was the closest doctor
place, and it was an emergency.</i>

333
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,621
<i>No, I can see that.</i>

334
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:31,851
<i>But even if I was a vet,
the rabbit... is dead.</i>

335
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:37,543
I'm sorry, guys.

336
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:41,347
Everything smells
different when it rains.

337
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,435
What do we do now?

338
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:49,556
Well, you should bury him, I guess.

339
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:52,676
I don't know, give him a...
a nice funeral.

340
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:54,631
Has he gone to heaven?

341
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,784
Yeah, sure. Uh, sure...
sure, he has. Um...

342
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,793
No, I don't want him to go to
heaven! I want him to be here!

343
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:09,792
This won't happen again.

344
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:12,307
It can't happen again. He's dead.

345
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:13,427
I know that.

346
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:16,130
I mean, nothing like this
is ever going to happen to us,

347
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,450
ever again.

348
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:20,015
Because we're not going home.

349
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,351
We're never going home again.

350
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:25,120
We have each other,
and that's all we need.

351
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,990
A surgeon needs to communicate...

352
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:42,212
not just information,
but sympathy, empathy.

353
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:44,421
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

354
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,735
He can't even reliably show up
for a job interview.

355
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:50,586
Are you gonna sit here
and tell us that there were

356
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,798
no other equally-qualified
young surgeons...

357
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:59,337
surgeons without this one's... issues?

358
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,259
No.

359
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:04,929
Which is why... exactly why...
we should hire Shaun.

360
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:07,736
We should hire him
because he is qualified

361
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,845
and because he is different.

362
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,706
How long ago was it
that we wouldn't hire

363
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,400
black doctors in this hospital?

364
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,705
How m... How long ago was it
that we wouldn't hire

365
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:18,080
female doctors at this hospital?

366
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:21,382
So, you're comparing
being African-American

367
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,776
or a woman with being autistic.

368
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:25,880
Please, go on...

369
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:28,878
Okay.

370
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,650
The rationalization is exactly the same.

371
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,712
Words like "temperament"
and, "Oh, no! Ohh!

372
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,626
How are the patients going to react?"

373
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,817
Aren't we judged by how we treat people?

374
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:44,060
I don't mean as doctors.
I mean as people.

375
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:46,138
Especially those who... who don't have

376
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,240
the same advantages that we have.

377
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,074
We hire Shaun,
and we give hope to those people

378
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:52,965
with limitations that those limitations

379
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,266
are not what they think they are,

380
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,300
that they<i> do</i> have a shot!

381
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,097
We hire Shaun, and we make this
hospital better for it.

382
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:11,729
We hire Shaun, and we are
better people for it.

383
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,455
We'd be "better people,"

384
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:19,889
spending a lot more on
malpractice insurance.

385
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,811
- How old is this kid again?
- 8.

386
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,528
Spong stick.

387
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,464
What was his heart rate
five minutes ago?

388
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:35,738
- Uh, 86.
- You sure?

389
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,535
Certain. He's been a rock.
It's barely changed.

390
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,847
No, something's changed.
Something's different.

391
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:47,517
You asked earlier about an echo.

392
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:49,941
You had no medical reason,
but you asked anyway. Why?

393
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,865
There was this weird guy,
the one that did

394
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,856
the one-way valve, he kept insisting

395
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:56,687
that the boy needed an echocardiogram.

396
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:59,882
- He didn't say why?
- H-He was really weird.

397
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,612
His blood pressure's dropping.
That makes no sense.

398
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:06,721
He's not bleeding anymore.
Everything's under control.

399
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,648
Do an echo.

400
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,800
Sir, the boy is wide open.
It's gonna take awhile.

401
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:12,376
Good. That'll give me time to figure out

402
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:13,633
why the hell we're doing an echo.

403
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:14,982
Dr. Browne, you're with me.

404
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:16,332
We're gonna go find your weird guy.

405
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:18,110
Keep him stable.

406
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,758
Why the echo?

407
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:27,640
Uh, okay. He, uh... He... Okay.

408
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,907
Uh, he... Uh, I, uh... He...

409
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:34,801
Okay. I understand you think
he needs an echocardiogram.

410
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:36,791
We just don't know why.

411
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:40,038
Well, I-I noticed that
there was a slight reduction

412
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,140
in the intensity
of the electrocardiogram.

413
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:44,618
The electrical flow...
I noticed that, too.

414
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:47,234
The heart rate was the same,
but the amplitude dropped.

415
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,524
Pericardial effusion.

416
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:49,948
Reduced cardiac output.

417
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,517
Would stress other organs.

418
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,851
Causing them to shut down.

419
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,347
Yes.

420
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:57,755
Hold on.

421
00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,917
Yeah, we're coming right back up...

422
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,902
Thank you.

423
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:04,362
They did the echo. It's normal.

424
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,729
No pericardial effusion.

425
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,518
No. It has to be. There...
There is no other explanation.

426
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:12,261
The echo is normal, which
means we just wasted our time.

427
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:14,243
N-No.

428
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:27,079
Okay, um, hey, come with me.

429
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,166
Come on.

430
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,108
Show them.

431
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:54,725
Again.

432
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,047
Again.

433
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:03,343
Again.

434
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:05,277
There.

435
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:07,353
Looks normal to me.

436
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:08,999
It's not normal.

437
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:11,490
There's a concave deformity
in the right atrium.

438
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:13,424
Um, no, there's not.

439
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,660
Yeah. Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

440
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:16,715
Even if you are right,

441
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,741
that's not where a pericardial
effusion manifests.

442
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:23,978
Not usually.

443
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,939
But it... it could.

444
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:32,259
This kid was sprayed with glass
shards... cut his jugular.

445
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:35,229
What if a piece of glass
entered his blood stream?

446
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:38,097
It could have traveled
down the jugular vein,

447
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,850
into the brachiocephalic vein

448
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,552
and on to the superior vena cava.

449
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:44,220
If it punctured the SVC,
blood could be leaking

450
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:46,148
behind the heart,
restricting the heart's ability

451
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:48,091
to expand and fill during diastole,

452
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:49,559
reducing the heart's efficiency.

453
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,015
Lot of ifs there.

454
00:26:57,134 --> 00:27:01,407
Dr. Chen, pair of 14-gauge on a syringe.

455
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:08,710
All in favor of ratifying
Dr. Glassman's decision

456
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:10,881
in hiring Dr. Shaun Murphy?

457
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,124
All against.

458
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:21,737
Excuse me.

459
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,094
Is this a medical emergency?

460
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,228
No. No medical emergency...

461
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,404
Then you weren't
supposed to interrupt...

462
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,773
Yes, I know, but you need to go online.

463
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:29,787
- What? What site?
- Pretty much any of them...

464
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:32,611
Twitter, YouTube, any local news site.

465
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:39,418
<i>He saved his life!</i>

466
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,262
The YouTube clip already has
over 200,000 views.

467
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,028
Apparently, he's one of our doctors.

468
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:52,417
Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy?

469
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:55,464
The boy is in O.R. 2.

470
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,263
Dr. Melendez isn't sure
if he's going to make it.

471
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:11,168
Your fiancé sure can handle a knife.

472
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,733
Why did you warn me about
respecting Dr. Andrews?

473
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:21,354
What's going on?

474
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,183
I'm not gonna always
be here to protect you.

475
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:26,370
You think you're gonna lose?

476
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:29,659
Everybody loses...

477
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,537
eventually.

478
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,511
Is that your guy?

479
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,527
Can we get a TV?

480
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:55,852
No.

481
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,902
Why not?

482
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,327
Because we're poor, dude.

483
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,269
We live in a bus.

484
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:06,214
Do you think Mom is looking for us?

485
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,198
Nope.

486
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:16,503
She loves us, but she knows
it's better this way.

487
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:29,168
I got you a present.

488
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,973
It's not my birthday.

489
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:32,918
I got you a present anyway.

490
00:29:50,578 --> 00:29:52,303
Here.

491
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,948
Kelly.

492
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,127
Dr. Browne...

493
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,259
You were right.

494
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,958
- I don't like pickles.
- I know.

495
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,929
- I don't want pickles.
- And I checked.

496
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:28,501
You saved that boy's life.

497
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,073
Oh, good.

498
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:32,017
His name is Adam.

499
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:34,548
Traumatic pneumothorax.

500
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,234
I'm hungry.

501
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:43,114
Board reconvenes in 45 minutes.

502
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,489
Can you stay here until I get back?

503
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:52,051
Okay.

504
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,751
Okay.

505
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:05,175
He's got a serious deficit.

506
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,495
A child is alive today
because of that deficit.

507
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,385
And tomorrow, one may
be dead because of it.

508
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,566
I seem to remember that
when I hired you,

509
00:32:11,568 --> 00:32:15,588
you weren't exactly making
the most adult decisions.

510
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:17,963
You haven't killed anyone yet. Have you?

511
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:20,441
Well, thankfully,
there's a cure for youth

512
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:22,743
and stupidity... time and experience.

513
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:25,944
There's a cure for stupidity? Okay.

514
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,980
That would be a windfall.

515
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,952
All Shaun has is a diagnosis.

516
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,045
I'd like your help.

517
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,913
I take it I'm not gonna get it.

518
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:39,913
Okay.

519
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:42,422
Wait.

520
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:44,607
What's the story with this kid?

521
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,646
Why is it so important to you?

522
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,035
Why not?

523
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:53,138
Because letting things
get personal is a sure formula

524
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,325
for screwing things up.

525
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,443
I don't know.

526
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,341
Letting things get personal is how we...

527
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:03,748
...how we make it matter.

528
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:15,028
So, are you proud or disappointed?

529
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,058
Do I have to pick just one?

530
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,922
Hey.

531
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,740
You're new to town, right?

532
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,297
Yes.

533
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,511
Well, I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

534
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:35,855
No.

535
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:38,167
Uh...

536
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:42,518
You got to be curious about
the place, about the people.

537
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,087
Dr. Glassman gave me
a map of the hospital,

538
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,795
and I got a map of San Jose online.

539
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,241
Okay.

540
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,850
Great.

541
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:00,794
I do have one question.

542
00:34:00,937 --> 00:34:02,607
Yeah?

543
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,681
Why were you rude to me
when we first met,

544
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,643
then nicer to me the second time we met,

545
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,681
and now you want to be my friend?

546
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:14,119
Which time was it
that you were pretending?

547
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,631
Shaun. We're ready.

548
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:30,797
The vote was clear.
Why are we reopening this?

549
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,698
Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?

550
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,867
It's because the man just
saved somebody's life.

551
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,169
And thank God for that,

552
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,703
but it doesn't change
a single thing we discussed.

553
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,072
Give him six months.

554
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:42,575
If he proves anything
less than excellent...

555
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:45,153
Someone "less than excellent"
means someone else dies.

556
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:47,907
Well, I-I would love
to make you happy, Doctor.

557
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:51,083
I would love to hire someone
who never, ever makes a mistake.

558
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,985
Unfortunately, God already has a job.

559
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,354
I can accept that he will have insights

560
00:34:56,356 --> 00:34:58,324
that none of the rest of us will have.

561
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:00,192
Can you accept that
he will make mistakes

562
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:01,293
none of the rest of us will make?

563
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:03,667
You won't be the one who pays the price.

564
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:13,174
If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

565
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:15,728
he will be immediately released.

566
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,444
And I will resign my position
as President of this hospital.

567
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,515
We haven't heard from Dr. Murphy yet.

568
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:29,669
Perhaps we should hear from him
before we decide his fate.

569
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,763
Shaun...

570
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:50,254
Dr. Murphy...

571
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:55,377
I'd like you to tell us why
you want to become a surgeon.

572
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:15,604
Why do I want them to be my friends?

573
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,620
Everybody needs friends, Shaun.

574
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:21,168
It's gonna be cool, okay?
Play hide and seek maybe?

575
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,570
- Okay.
- Tag in the warehouse?

576
00:36:29,077 --> 00:36:31,544
Hey, stop following me.

577
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:06,850
- Told ya it was fun, right?
- Shh!

578
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:14,718
Hey, you know what?

579
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:54,804
The day that the rain
smelled like ice cream,

580
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,241
my bunny went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

581
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,773
The day that the copper pipes
in the old building

582
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:09,945
smelled like burnt food,

583
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:13,635
my brother...

584
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,911
went to heaven in front of my eyes.

585
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:23,989
I couldn't save them.

586
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,599
It's sad.

587
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,687
Neither one had the chance
to become an adult.

588
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:38,062
They should have become adults.

589
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:43,034
They should have had
children of their own

590
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:47,220
and loved those children.

591
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,741
And I want to make that possible

592
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:56,014
for other people.

593
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,491
And I want to make a lot of money

594
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:11,100
so that I can have a television.

595
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:23,704
Dr. Murphy...

596
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:30,278
I want to be the first to welcome you

597
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,982
to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

598
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:38,302
We're very proud to have you.

599
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:53,035
Shaun, Dr. Melendez's
team is going into surgery.

600
00:39:53,854 --> 00:39:56,621
I mean, if you're interested.

601
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,549
Got a messy field here.

602
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,299
Murphy.

603
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,102
Suction.

604
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,014
Never forget, you're the smart one.

605
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:24,186
You can do anything.

606
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:27,116
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

607
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:35,697
Bet you've seen many of these.

608
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,299
I remember my first.

609
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:44,119
Kept thinking, "It doesn't get
any better than this."

610
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,419
And for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

611
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:54,184
You're a nice kid,
and you're obviously very smart,

612
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:56,833
but you don't belong here.

613
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,703
So, as long as you're part of my team,

614
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:03,180
this is all you're ever
going to be doing... suction.

615
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:10,768
I saw a lot of surgeons
in medical school.

616
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,386
You're much better than them.

617
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,557
I have a lot to learn from you.

618
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:25,556
You're very arrogant.

619
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:29,797
Do you think that helps you
be a good surgeon?

620
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:32,836
Does it hurt you as a person?

621
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,273
Is it worth it?

622
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:47,851
